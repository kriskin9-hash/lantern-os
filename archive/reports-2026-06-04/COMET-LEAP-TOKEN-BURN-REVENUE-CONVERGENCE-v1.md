# COMET LEAP Token Burn And Revenue Convergence v1

Generated: 2026-05-26

Local master repo: `C:\tmp\lantern-os`

Canonical remote link to use in PDFs: `https://github.com/alex-place/lantern-os`

Status: operator-review draft, built with the Lantern OS 12-step convergence loop.

## Executive Answer

The previous low-confidence answer was weak because it mixed shallow market
searches, token-cost claims, and revenue projections without enough independent
evidence classes. This version raises confidence only where the evidence is
strong:

- **High confidence:** cloud token unit costs, offline/server-farm Foundry
  token policy, repo artifact existence, current dirty repo state, service
  streams that can be sold manually now.
- **Medium confidence:** 30-90 day revenue targets from founder-led service
  packaging.
- **Low confidence:** scaled 12-month revenue without live conversion data.

The fastest money is not a token economy. It is founder-led paid installation,
caregiver/accessibility setup, homeschool/local AI tutoring setup, and COMET
LEAP report packaging. Token issuance remains a later financing instrument, not
a first revenue stream.

## Method Upgrade

Old method: three-ish web searches plus projection.

New method:

1. Use official API pricing for token costs.
2. Separate **token burn** from **cash burn**.
3. Use Buffett-style owner earnings: revenue minus operating costs minus
   maintenance reinvestment.
4. Use persona streams only where a payment path exists now.
5. Score confidence from evidence class, not optimism.
6. Prefer manual service revenue before SaaS scaling claims.
7. Treat crypto/token issuance as optional financing, not core revenue.
8. Split past, present, and future into 12 convergence frames.
9. Record blockers and next build actions.
10. Attach repo and PDF links.
11. Run local convergence loop.
12. Promote only after operator review.

## Token Burn Cost Model

Admin rule: **offline-only/local/server-farm Foundry tokens are unmetered
internal capacity**. Do not label local inference as "Lite", do not rate it per
token, and do not present it as a scarce customer billable unless an external
provider, rented GPU, or hardware lease is actually charging for the work.
Foundry capacity is bounded by owned hardware, queue time, thermals, power,
storage, network, maintenance, and operator policy, not vendor token price.

The tables below are only for cloud/API escalation cost.

Assumptions per active family per month:

- 200 short local chats.
- 40 cloud-assisted chats.
- Average cloud chat: 2,000 input tokens, 600 output tokens.
- Monthly cloud tokens per family: 80,000 input, 24,000 output.
- Local-first default sends only sensitive summaries or opt-in escalations to
  cloud.

### Per-Family Monthly Token Cost

| Provider / Model Class | Input $/1M | Output $/1M | Cost Per Family / Month | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| OpenAI nano-class | 0.05 | 0.40 | $0.0136 | Best for classification, routing, simple summaries |
| OpenAI mini-class | 0.25 | 2.00 | $0.0680 | Good default cloud assist budget |
| OpenAI 4.1 mini-class | 0.40 | 1.60 | $0.0704 | Strong low-cost fallback |
| Anthropic Haiku-class | 1.00 | 5.00 | $0.2000 | Higher quality small-model path |
| Anthropic Sonnet-class | 3.00 | 15.00 | $0.6000 | Use only for high-stakes synthesis/review |
| Gemini Flash-class batch | 0.25 | 1.50 | $0.0560 | Strong batch/back-office candidate |

### Token Burn By Customer Count

| Families | Local/Server-Farm API Cost / Mo | Balanced Cloud Cost / Mo | Premium Cloud Review Cost / Mo |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | $0.00 API cost | $0.07 | $0.60 |
| 10 | $0.00 API cost | $0.68 | $6.00 |
| 50 | $0.00 API cost | $3.40 | $30.00 |
| 100 | $0.00 API cost | $6.80 | $60.00 |
| 500 | $0.00 API cost | $34.00 | $300.00 |
| 1,000 | $0.00 API cost | $68.00 | $600.00 |

Conclusion: **token burn is not the near-term threat. Human support time,
installation friction, trust, and distribution are the burn risks.**

## Buffett-Style Owner Earnings Lens

Owner earnings proxy:

```text
Owner earnings =
  cash collected
  - direct API/hosting/tool costs
  - customer support labor
  - required maintenance reinvestment
```

For Lantern OS, the best early owner-earnings streams are high-trust services
with low token cost:

- installation/setup;
- accessibility/caregiver configuration;
- homeschool/private learning setup;
- COMET LEAP report packaging;
- local RAG/IP compression.

## 12 Convergence Confidence Tables

- below 40: idea only.

## Money Streams To Build Now

Build these first because they need little new code and have direct payment
logic:

1. **Windows Lantern Surface Setup**: package existing icon, shortcuts, docs,
   and local launchers. Sell as setup/help.
2. **COMET LEAP Founder Report Pack**: cash runway, confidence report,
   30-day model, truth-only report.
3. **RAG/IP Compression Sprint**: convert messy repo/docs into claim-indexed
   mini states.
4. **Caregiver/Accessibility Setup**: local-first simplification with explicit
   non-medical boundary.
5. **Dual Boot Planning Packet**: paid planning and checklist; physical install
   remains operator-controlled.

## Token Strategy

Do not launch a crypto token now.

If "token" means LLM token burn:

- treat offline/local/server-farm Foundry tokens as unmetered internal capacity;
- remove "Lite" and per-token rating language from local/offline offers;
- use local-first routing;
- batch non-urgent synthesis;
- cache system prompts;
- use nano/mini models for routing;
- reserve Sonnet/frontier models for review and evidence synthesis.

If "token" means crypto/tokenomics:

- hold until there is revenue, a community, and legal review;
- avoid promises of yield, profit, governance authority, or investment return;
- use credits or prepaid service units before any public token instrument.

## One-Shot Decision

The higher-confidence build path is:

```text
Week 1: paid setup + report pack
Week 2: RAG/IP compression sprint
Week 3: caregiver/homeschool pilot
Week 4: subscription checkout only if manual buyers exist
```

This keeps owner earnings positive, avoids token theater, and turns the existing
COMET LEAP artifacts into cashable services before scaling software.
