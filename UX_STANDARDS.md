## Wording Standards

### Tone & Voice
✓ **Hopeful, not toxic** — acknowledge challenges, highlight solutions and progress
✓ **Action-oriented** — "What would you like to do?" not "Here's what you should know"
✓ **Conversational** — avoid jargon, explain concepts simply
✓ **Evidence-based** — all claims can be linked to sources or research
✓ **Present-tense and relatable** — "Right Now" not "Dashboard Status"
✓ **Lead with benefits** — "Conservation works" before "Species are declining"

### Section Naming
- **Hero section:** Positive, question-driven
  - ✓ "Is the world flourishing?" 
  - ✓ "Your dreams. Your data. Your Lantern."
  - ✗ "System Status" or "Current Status"

- **Action sections:** User-focused
  - ✓ "What would you like to do?"
  - ✓ "Start here"
  - ✗ "Features" or "Available Tools"

- **Info sections:** Present-tense
  - ✓ "Right Now" (measurements)
  - ✓ "How Different Groups Are Doing"
  - ✗ "Live Data" or "Current Metrics"

### Description Format
**Max 2-3 sentences per panel.** Structure:

1. **Lead with benefit or action** — Why should the user engage?
2. **Clarify the experience** — What will they find or do?
3. **Optional tagline or emotion** — How will it feel?

Examples:
- ✓ "Record what you remember, talk to an AI companion, and build your private dream archive. Everything stays on your computer."
- ✓ "Real-time data on human wellbeing, animal welfare, and ecosystem health—updated every few seconds."
- ✗ "View the current system status and metrics dashboard with live telemetry"

### Label Capitalization
- **Section labels:** UPPERCASE (0.72rem, accent color)
- **Card labels:** UPPERCASE (0.65-0.68rem, accent color)
- **Titles:** Title Case (normal H2/H3)

### Framing Challenges
When discussing problems, pair with solutions:

| Problem | Framing |
|---------|---------|
| Wildlife declining 68% | "Wildlife down 68% since 1970. Conservation actually works—species recover when protected." |
| Mental health rising | "Mental health challenges increasing in wealthy nations. Improving in some younger demographics." |
| Inequality growing | "Inequality growing, limiting real freedom. But extreme poverty is declining globally." |

## When to Deviate

Okay to deviate when:
- ✓ Accessibility requires it (contrast, sizing, etc.)
- ✓ Brand identity demands it (logo, hero style, special pages)
- ✓ Technical constraints force it (mobile, performance)

Not okay to deviate when:
- ✗ "It looks nicer"
- ✗ "I prefer this wording"
- ✗ Readability or tone suffers

**When in doubt, ask:** Does this improve clarity, accessibility, or action? If yes, consider deviating. If no, follow standards.
