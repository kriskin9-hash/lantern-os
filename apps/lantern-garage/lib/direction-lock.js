/**
 * direction-lock.js — one account, one direction per underlying FAMILY.
 *
 * The trading engines are longs-only in INSTRUMENTS, but an inverse ETF is an
 * economic SHORT on its underlying — so "long SQQQ" and "long QQQ/TQQQ" in the
 * same account is a hedged-with-fees contradiction (net ≈ 0 exposure, double
 * commissions, double 3× decay), and it can arise two real ways:
 *   1. sequentially inside the intraday engine (buy TQQQ in the morning uptrend;
 *      the reversal turns SQQQ trend-aligned before TQQQ's exits fire), and
 *   2. across engines (intraday holds SQQQ on a downtrend day; at 15:45 the
 *      overnight book's capitulation sleeve buys QQQ on the very same condition).
 *
 * The lock: map every instrument to (underlying family, sign), derive the
 * account's live net direction per family from its positions, and refuse any
 * ENTRY whose sign opposes existing family exposure. Closing positions is never
 * blocked (it reduces exposure). Cross-family offsets (TQQQ + TZA = long tech /
 * short small-caps) are deliberately allowed — that's relative value, not a
 * contradiction. The convex "profit whichever way it breaks" construct belongs
 * to the OPTIONS trader, not to linear ETF pairs with wide stops.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free; both engines call `conflicts(sym, positions)`.

// A 3x wrapper at 6% of equity carries 18% of market risk. Nothing in sizing,
// the gross cap (maxGrossPct, measured on NOTIONAL) or the family lock knew
// that, so concentration was invisible: on 2026-08-18 SMH (12.1%) + SOXL (6.0%
// notional, 18.1% beta-adjusted) put 30.2% of the book in semis at 09:30 and
// semis fell 4.33% — 67% of that day's loss, from an exposure no log reported.
//
// This map exists to MEASURE, not to constrain. The measured record is explicit
// that leverage is where the edge lives (2026-08 round trips: 3x wrappers n=17,
// +$7,647, +0.714% per trade on notional; 1x n=59, +$2,991, +0.057%) and that
// the two HIGHEST-concentration sessions were the two best days (SOXS alone at
// 53.7% beta on 8/13 and 8/14: +$2,145 and +$6,803). Every cap level tested in
// the observed range removed more profit than loss, so no cap ships — only the
