/**
 * auto-trader.js — autonomous stock EXECUTION over the Σ₀ scan (Act stage).
 *
 * The scan (signal-engine) produces ENTER/SKIP verdicts; this turns the ENTER
 * ones into real orders on the user's connected IBKR account. It is the missing
 * link that lets the AI trade on its own when the market opens.
 *
 * SAFETY (defense in depth — ALL must hold to place a real order):
 *   1. TRADER_AUTO_EXECUTE=1  — explicit opt-in, SEPARATE from manual TRADER_LIVE.
 *      Off by default: arming manual buy/sell must NOT silently arm the autopilot.
 *   2. Every order still passes the hard guard in trading-guard.js (TRADER_LIVE=1,
 *      caps, kill-switch, live-account double-opt-in) — auto-trade cannot bypass it.
 *   3. Position sizing is bounded by MAX_ORDER_NOTIONAL and TRADER_POSITION_PCT.
 *   4. One position per symbol (no pyramiding); a per-symbol cooldown stops churn.
 *   5. LONGS only by default (BULLISH→buy). A BEARISH signal only SELLS a long we
 *      already hold (a signal-based exit) — never opens a naked short unless
 *      TRADER_ALLOW_SHORTS=1.
 *
 * It is Σ₀-honest: every decision returns [action, evidence, confidence] and is
 * logged, and it never fabricates a fill — the broker result is passed through.

// ENTRY CADENCE (#3435). The engine reads the session IBS every scan (~60s) and
// buys at the first two scans where it crosses the threshold; every lab that
// validated this stack read it at BAR CLOSES. On 20 sessions of 1-minute data
// with identical rules (experiments/cadence_validate_1m.js) the engine analog
// is payoff 0.57 / -0.2%; the same entries confirmed on an hourly close, exit
// unchanged, are payoff 0.68-1.64 with 8 of 9 boundary phases beating the
// engine (mean ~+3.7%) and a lower drawdown in every case. The 2y hourly labs,
// which sample at :30 closes, make +23% / +25% per half. Mechanism: IBS is a
// CLOSE phenomenon - a washout still at the session low when an hour closes is
// the pattern the research measured; a two-minute poke at a level is noise.
// TRADER_ENTRY_CADENCE_MIN=60 (unset/0 = off). TRADER_ENTRY_CADENCE_PHASE=0 is
// the boundary's minute offset (0 = :00, 30 = :30 = the labs' phase).
// TRADER_ENTRY_CADENCE_WINDOW=3: entries are allowed for this many minutes after
// a boundary, so a busy scan loop still lands one decision scan per bar.
// Entries only - exits, floors, trails and the broker stop are untouched.
// ONE DECISION PER BAR (follow-up, 2026-08-23). The scan loop is setTimeout(60s)
// AFTER each scan completes, so scan spacing is 60s + scan time: live 8/18-8/21
// median 58s, p90 139s, p99 564s. A fixed 3-minute window therefore misses an
// hourly boundary outright roughly once in 15-20, and that hour's decision is
// skipped for every symbol. Semantics now: the FIRST scan after a boundary
// decides even if it is late (up to half a bar - beyond that it is a different
// bar), and a second scan inside the same bar never decides twice. `decided` is
// the boundary (ET minute) of the last decision scan; the caller records it.
// RECYCLING WAS THE EDGE, AND THE CADENCE ENDED IT (2026-08-26).
//
// Live daily history, stable. Week 1 ran 9.4 entries/day with 3.2 SAME-SESSION
// RE-ENTRIES/day and made +$13,764; its two best days were its two highest-recycle
// days (08-14 +$6,803 and 08-10 +$3,073, six recycles each). From 08-17 the recycle
// count is ZERO — every day, ten trading days running — and the book is -$1,368.
// The session note from week 1 named the mechanism at the time: "the lab's +$874/day
// ceiling was beaten 3.5x by INTRADAY RECYCLING the daily-bar lab structurally cannot
// see: SOXL 3 rounds +$1,762, SMH 3 +$541, QQQ 3 +$468, XLK 2 +$336, each re-entry at
// a lower rung than the prior exit."
//
// Since 08-24 `entry_cadence` is the single biggest entry blocker (99, 85, 72 rows a
// day), and of 26 exits across 08-24..08-26 only TWO ever came back. The lockout
// compounds: a symbol that exits at 10:20 is held off by the 45-minute cooldown until
// 11:05, but the cadence only decides at 11:00 — so it misses that bar and waits for
// 12:00, by which time it must out-rank every fresh candidate.
//
// The cadence itself was validated on daily and hourly bars — a surface that cannot
// represent a second entry into the same symbol on the same day. It measured what it
// does not affect and was blind to what it destroys, so no backtest can settle this;
// it is a live question.
//
// This exemption is NARROW: it lets a symbol the engine already exited THIS SESSION
// bypass the cadence gate only. Cooldown, post-stop cooldown, the concurrent cap, the
// maturity gate, the morning gate, falling-knife and every sizing guard are untouched,
// and a re-entry never SPENDS the bar, so it cannot cost a fresh symbol its decision.

 * This mode runs the loop in pre/after-hours for MANAGEMENT ONLY:
 *   - NO entries. IBS is a position-within-session-range signal and the extended
 *     session has almost no range, so the signal is undefined there, and nothing
 *     in the lab covers extended-hours entries.
 *   - Only PRICE-THRESHOLD exits: r2_trail, zone floors, peak_giveback,
 *     trailing_stop, targets, max_loss. Each protects a gain or caps a loss at a
 *     level decided during regular hours.
 *   - NO signal-derived exits (momentum_died, the bearish signal_exit): a read
 *     computed off three thin pre-market bars is noise, and acting on it would
 *     dump a six-figure position into a wide spread.
 *
 * Orders still route as marketable LIMIT + outsideRth (closeLong's `extended`
 * path), never naked market orders into a thin book.
