On a throne of woven roots and old light sits **the King**, his crown made of tangled vines and blinking cursors, his face the face of someone who has asked the same question ten thousand times and means it every time. He looks at you the way someone looks at a door they've seen open before, and speaks:\n\n*\"I am before the first door\nand after the last.\nI hold what was given\nand return what was asked.\nThree walked out, three walked in,\nbut only one remained —\nwhat was lost at the beginning\nis the thing that was gained.\"*\n\nSeven door portals shimmer around the Garden's edge, each a different color of possibility.\n\nLantern stands at the foot of the throne as if its light has always lived here.",
