# Lantern OS

Fresh repository for the Lantern OS v1.0.0 line.

Lantern OS is the clean convergence target for the Windows, local-first, NixOS,
COMET LEAP, and household AI surfaces. This repo starts as a staging and release
control plane, not a dump of every prior artifact.

## Current Status

Status: pre-v1.0.0 staging

This repo is ready to receive promoted artifacts when the operator decides the
v1.0.0 line is ready. Until then, source repos remain authoritative:

- `C:\tmp\human-flourishing-frameworks-scan`
- `C:\Users\alexp\Documents\gm-agent-orchestrator`

Remote control plane: `https://github.com/alex-place/lantern-os`

Shareholder/repo consolidation map:
`manifests/foundry-shareholder-repos.md`

## Release Rule

Nothing becomes v1.0.0 here merely because it exists elsewhere. Promotion
requires the Lantern OS convergence loop in
`docs/CONVERGENCE-LOOP.md`.

Before adding new surfaces, run the loop and fix the first 2-4 open issues it
finds. Expansion is allowed only after the leading blockers are handled or
explicitly marked held by the operator.

## Non-Goals For This Repo

- No unattended bootloader edits.
- No partition or disk mutation scripts.
- No unreviewed generated artifact dump.
- No claim that v1.0.0 is ready before the operator says so.
- No skeleton-only milestones.
- No treating offline/local/server-farm Foundry tokens as cloud-metered,
  "Lite", or per-token rated.

## First Command
