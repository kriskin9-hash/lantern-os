Task P4-T8: Integration Testing — Three-Doors Kingdome Phase 4

Full gameplay loops with complete 7-stage progression across different
archetype/agent combinations. Tests: narration display, agent filtering,
symbol tracking, and edge cases.

Test Scenarios:
1. Seeker + Lantern (default combo) — all 7 stages
2. Healer + Xenon (archetype swap) — different door ordering
3. Explorer + Keystone (fox trigger + agent ordering)
4. Symbol Unlock Testing (2 loops for hidden door unlocks)
5. Edge Cases (narration length, concatenation, no truncation)

# This integration suite targets the pre-Kingdome ThreeDoorsEngine API:
# a ThreeDoorsGameState object (removed), _load_state/_save_state accessors,
# and "garden-at-beginning"-style stage names. The 7-stage Kingdome refactor
# (commit 4feec57d) replaced that with a dict-based engine (load/save/start_game/
# choose_door over STAGES like "kingdome-garden"), so every scenario here is
# written against an API that no longer exists. Skip at module level — with an
# honest reason — instead of erroring at import. The real fix is a rewrite to the
# current dict-based engine contract; tracked in #558.
