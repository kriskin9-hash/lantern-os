convergence_ev.py — Σ₀ expected-value decision layer over Riley's signals.

Riley's WAIT/GOOD/PERFECT tiers and "extreme-zones-only" gates exist to manage
HUMAN error — they keep a discretionary trader from overtrading and from acting
on partial confirmation. Keystone doesn't need that crutch: it can weigh every
piece of evidence at once and act on EXPECTED VALUE.

This module turns a candidate trade into a Convergence Record (one of Keystone's
four core objects):  hypothesis + evidence + confidence + result.  Riley's
detectors (zone, 1-min structure shift, candle pattern, trend) stay — but as
WEIGHTED EVIDENCE, not pass/fail gates. The decision is:

    p_win   = base_rate + Σ wᵢ·(signalᵢ − 0.5)        # transparent linear model
    EV (R)  = p_win·target_R − (1 − p_win)·1R          # risk one R to make target_R
    ENTER   iff EV ≥ EV_MIN and p_win ≥ P_MIN          # no discretionary tiers

Every record carries `why` (the evidence that moved it) so the call is auditable
— the External-Reality Rule: [claim, evidence, confidence, source]. Pure +
dependency-free so it unit-tests without Alpaca or the rest of the engine.

    The engine risks a flat $ per trade regardless of conviction; the old Kelly
    path that was meant to vary size is dead (place_order takes a qty_override).
    This revives the intent: lean in on high-conviction setups, lean out on
    marginal ones — but *centred on 1.0* so it does not net-inflate risk (a pure
    half-Kelly saturates the cap for almost every gate-passing p_win at 3R, which
    would just be a blanket +50%). Sizing is driven by the calibrated hit-rate
    p_win (target_r already governs the ENTER/SKIP decision in the EV gate):
