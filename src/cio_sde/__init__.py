CIO Neural SDE — Convergence IO as a controlled stochastic differential system (#392)

Realizes the Convergence 1.0 compact core as a runnable PyTorch dynamical system:

    dx = f(x, u, G) dt + g(x) dW          (execution — drift + diffusion)
    dΣ = AΣ + ΣAᵀ + Q − ΣCᵀR⁻¹CΣ          (uncertainty — Kalman-Bucy Riccati)
    dλ = −∂H/∂x                            (co-state — Pontryagin adjoint)
    u* = argmin H(x, u, λ, Σ)              (control — PCSF policy)

Mapping to CIO theory:
    x      runtime + memory state
    Σ      dilation / uncertainty field  (D(v) derived from tr Σ)
    u      PCSF control action (policy network)
    G      execution graph (swappable dynamics modules)
    f, g   deterministic execution / exploration noise
    σ:v→v  hot-swap = behaviour-preserving module reparameterization

The four CIO invariants are enforced in code:
    1. constraints dominate optimization   (NAP clamp in PCSFController)
    2. all execution is traceable          (Trace, replayable by seed)
    3. graph mutations preserve validity   (hot-swap equivalence guard)
    4. divergence regimes are detected     (StabilityReport)
