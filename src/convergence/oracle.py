"""
The Convergence Oracle — time-banded observer slices between the big bang and the heat death.

The oracle grounds knowledge on the two PINS of cosmic time:

    big bang  (t = 0,    ~13.787 Gyr ago)  — the known beginning, minimum entropy
    heat death (t → ∞,   ~10^100 yr ahead) — the predicted end, maximum entropy

Between them the timeline is divided into BANDS. Each band is an **observer slice**: what an
observer there can KNOW (each a 4-field External-Reality envelope `[claim, evidence,
confidence, source]`) and what is UNKNOWN. The arrow of time — entropy rising from the
big-bang minimum to the heat-death maximum — *is* the grounding direction, so the oracle
collapses on knowns and unknowns **both ways**:

    forward  — what known physics DETERMINES from the big bang (observed/predicted: inflation→now)
    backward — what the terminal heat death CONSTRAINS (the 2nd law: degenerate era→dark era)

A slice the present sits in is grounded BOTH ways (forward prediction and backward constraint
meet at "now" — the best-observed slice). The two pins themselves — the singularity and the
ultimate fate — are the deepest UNKNOWNS: the oracle is honest that the boundaries are
inferred, not observed.

This is the [Question Machine](../../docs/research/question-machine.md)'s bidirectional
consolidation (beginning-forward ⇄ end-back) with the cosmic endpoints as the boundary
conditions, and the [Σ₀ collapse certificate](../../docs/SIGMA0-COLLAPSE-CERTIFICATE.md)'s
collapse onto the grounded manifold (knowns) with the unknowns as the null space. The oracle
hands a slice to a questioner: it locates the question in cosmic time and returns the grounded
knowns + the honest unknowns for that band.
