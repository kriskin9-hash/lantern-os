"""Convergence Router — emit ConvergenceRecords for routing decisions (wq-006).

The router decides how to handle a query: a deterministic local cache/pattern hit,
or an external compute fallback. Each decision is one reasoning cycle, recorded as a
ConvergenceRecord so routing becomes observable, learnable, and verifiable — the
Reason stage of the Convergence Loop.

Confidence reflects the decision's grounding:
- a cache hit is high-confidence  (a known route pattern matched deterministically)
- a pattern match is fairly high   (a learned pattern matched)
- a compute fallback is lower      (no cached pattern; a model/heuristic chose)
- a bare fallback is lowest        (default route, no evidence)

Reference: apps/lantern-garage/lib/convergence-router.js (120 Keystone routes,
>70% cache hit rate); src/convergence/objects.py::ConvergenceRecord.
