Σ₀ Coder Gate — verification contract for the Keystone coding agent.

Issue #628: the local coder (Ollama / qwen2.5-coder) inherited Dream Chat persona
tone from the single shared system-prompt builder in unified_agent_connector.py,
so its output read like RP narration ("end with one question or invitation to
record") instead of evidence-grounded code. Keystone is being updated from the
"truth integrator" persona into the system's coding agent, and it needs a
verification contract that is SEPARATE from the dream/RP surface.

This module supplies three things and nothing else (reject sprawl):

  1. KEYSTONE_CODER_PROMPT — a code-verification persona prompt with no dream tone.
  2. build_pre_generation_gate() — caps confidence when no grounding evidence is
     supplied. This mirrors LANTERN-DREAM's `max_confidence = 0.3 until verified`
     rule, inverted: the coder must EARN confidence with evidence, never assume it.
  3. check_coder_output() — a structural checker that refuses to promote coder
     output into a ConvergenceRecord unless it carries the five required fields:
     Claim, Evidence, Confidence, Source, Verification.

Reference: docs/CONVERGANCE-SIGMA0-BRIEFING.md
           [06] LANTERN-CODER  — "Coder = a task type, not a separate system."
           [07] LANTERN-VERIFY — "Every claim must have: claim, evidence, confidence, source."
           [08] LANTERN-DREAM  — "confidence = max 0.3 until verified."

    "say you have not seen it.\n"

    "verified (the test, the command, the expected output).\n"
