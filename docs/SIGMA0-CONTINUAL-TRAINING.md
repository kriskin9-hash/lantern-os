This documents the **continual-training loop** for the
[Σ₀ Ouro Coder](SIGMA0-OURO-CODER.md): the offline pipeline that turns the system's own
execution-verified coding successes into a better local adapter, gated end-to-end by
ground truth. It closes the data→train→promote flywheel that was previously hand-cranked.

## The loop

```
 harvest ──▶ execution-verify ──▶ train ──▶ eval ──▶ EVAL-GATED promote ──▶ (repeat)
   │             │                   │         │              │
   │             │                   │         │              └─ swap final/ iff
   │             │                   │         │                 pass@1 ≥ incumbent + margin
   │             │                   │         └─ HumanEval pass@1 on candidate AND incumbent
   │             │                   └─ QLoRA r16/α32 on the verified set (gated; ~hours)
   │             └─ compile + exec + run asserts in an isolated subprocess
   │                THE Σ₀ GROUND-TRUTH GATE — only a green subprocess counts
   └─ gather {fn, instruction, code, asserts} from the system's own runs
```

| Stage | Script | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **harvest** | [`scripts/harvest_coding_corpus.py`](../scripts/harvest_coding_corpus.py) | ✅ built + run |
| **execution-verify** | `build_ouro_coding_dataset.load_extra_candidates` (sandboxed subprocess) | ✅ built + run |
| **train** | [`scripts/train-qlora-ouro.py`](../scripts/train-qlora-ouro.py) | ✅ built (GPU, opt-in) |
| **eval** | [`scripts/eval_humaneval_ouro.py`](../scripts/eval_humaneval_ouro.py) | ✅ built |
| **eval-gated promote** | [`scripts/continual_ouro_pipeline.py`](../scripts/continual_ouro_pipeline.py) `stage_promote` | ✅ built + self-tested |

The orchestrator is [`scripts/continual_ouro_pipeline.py`](../scripts/continual_ouro_pipeline.py).

## The two ground-truth gates

This loop has exactly two places where something is accepted, and **both require
external evidence**, per the Σ₀ rule (*nothing is accepted without evidence*):

1. **Into training — execution gate.** Every harvested candidate is compiled, `exec`'d,
   and run against its own `assert`s in an **isolated subprocess with a timeout**
   (`verify_candidate_sandboxed`). A model's claim that its code works does **not** count;
   only `returncode == 0` counts. Anything that errors, infinite-loops, or fails an
   assertion is dropped. *(Evidence: a first run verified **185/186** harvested
   candidates; the one drop was a real `AssertionError` the gate caught.)*

2. **Into production — eval gate.** A newly trained adapter replaces the live `final/`
   adapter **only if** its HumanEval `pass@1` beats the incumbent's by `--margin`
   (default: any strict improvement). Ties and regressions are rejected; `final/` is
   untouched. The decision is a pure, unit-tested function (`decide_promotion`); the
   incumbent is backed up to `final.bak-<ts>/` before any swap.

## Teacher backends — cloud or LOCAL (crystallization)

The distillation harvester `scripts/gen_sigma0_traces.py` (a TEACHER solves each task under
the Σ₀ prompt; only execution-green solutions become training rows) now has a **pluggable
teacher backend**:

| Backend | Teacher | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `cloud` (default for `claude-*` ids) | Anthropic Messages API (frontier model) | strongest corpus; needs a key + network |
| `local` (auto for ollama-style ids, e.g. `qwen2.5-coder:7b`) | any Ollama-compatible `/api/chat` server | **fully local crystallization** — no cloud, key, or rate limit |

**Crystallization** = distilling the verified-capable local **Qwen2.5-Coder-7B** teacher's
execution-green solutions into the small looped **Ouro-1.4B** student. The gate is unchanged:
teacher quality is self-limiting because only code that *runs* trains — a weaker teacher just
yields a smaller corpus, never wrong code. Run it:

```bash
# LOCAL Qwen teacher → Ouro student (offline)
python scripts/gen_sigma0_traces.py --tasks data/distill/crystallize-tasks.jsonl \
    --teacher qwen2.5-coder:7b --out data/distill/sigma0-traces.jsonl --limit 192
# then train + eval-gate exactly as below (train on data/distill/sigma0-traces.jsonl)
```

Design + a measured seed run:
[research/2026-07-02-qwen-teacher-ouro-crystallization.md](research/2026-07-02-qwen-teacher-ouro-crystallization.md).

## Harvest sources

The harvester normalizes `{fn, instruction, code, asserts}` candidates from the system's
own runs, dedups (by name + code hash), and writes one `--extra-candidates` JSONL:

- **`data/ouro-corpus-raw.json`** — the multi-agent corpus receipt (a 12-agent run
  produced 192 candidates). *Populated today.*
- **`--source-jsonl <path>`** (repeatable) — the **live-run extension point**: any future
  stream of coding successes that autowork / keystone / chat emit as
  `{fn, instruction, code, asserts}` rows. *Interface built; no live emitter yet.*

**Normalization detail:** agent corpora emit a placeholder `def fn(...)` while labeling the
task with a descriptive name (`swap_case`). The harvester renames the function consistently
across instruction + code + asserts so the verifier accepts it and the training signal uses
real names.

**Deliberately NOT harvested:**
- `data/eval/humaneval/*.jsonl` passing completions — training on HumanEval would
  **contaminate** the `pass@1` eval the loop optimizes against. Excluded on purpose.
- `lessons.db` — that is the Kalshi/**trading** lessons store, not a coding-success source.

## The architectural boundary (why it's offline)

The [Σ₀ Briefing](CONVERGANCE-SIGMA0-BRIEFING.md) North Star states:

> **PERSISTENT LEARNING, NOT WEIGHT MODIFICATION.** Improve via retrieval and reasoning,
> not retraining.

QLoRA *is* weight modification. This loop survives that rule by being **offline, opt-in,
and outside the live request path**:

- It is a script you (or a cron) run — it is **never** invoked from chat / the live
  Observe→Reason→Act→Verify→Converge loop.
- The live loop still learns the Σ₀ way: append-only memory + routing leaderboard, no
  retraining.
- Promotion only swaps a **drop-in adapter** the model-broker already treats as one
  interchangeable local model — the architecture doesn't change, one pluggable brain does.

Wiring this into the live loop (auto-retrain on the fly) would cross that line and is
**out of scope by design**. The flywheel is real; a human or scheduled job spins it.

## Run it

```bash
# Safe default — harvest + execution-verify only; reports what WOULD train (no GPU):
.venv-train/Scripts/python scripts/continual_ouro_pipeline.py

# Verify the promote-gate logic with no GPU/model:
.venv-train/Scripts/python scripts/continual_ouro_pipeline.py --self-test

# Full loop on the GPU box (train → eval both → eval-gated promote):
.venv-train/Scripts/python scripts/continual_ouro_pipeline.py --train --eval --promote

# Eval-gate a pre-trained candidate against the incumbent (no retrain). The adapter dir
# is the one holding adapter_config.json — train-qlora-ouro.py writes that to <out>/final:
.venv-train/Scripts/python scripts/continual_ouro_pipeline.py \
    --candidate D:/lantern-train/ouro-sigma0-adapters/coding-v3/final --eval --promote --full
```

Outputs:
- `data/ouro-harvest-candidates.jsonl` — normalized candidates
- `models/lantern-sigma0-coder/training-data.harvested.jsonl` — base + verified rows (non-destructive)
- `data/eval/leaderboard.jsonl` — one `pass@1` summary row per eval
- `data/eval/ouro-promotion-log.jsonl` — append-only **Convergence Record** per promote decision

## Measured baseline (incumbent `final/`)

The promotion gate does **not** read a stored number — `stage_eval` **re-evaluates the
incumbent `final/` adapter live** each run and compares it to the candidate in memory.

**The full set is harder than the first-20 subset.** Logged points to date (FAST cached
path) were on a 20-problem slice: baseline HE-20 `pass@1 0.05` → coding-v3 HE-20
`pass@1 0.75`. The full 164-problem rerun (`ouro-final-rerun-full`) was attempted but
**did not complete** — no entry exists in `data/eval/leaderboard.jsonl` for it.
The in-flight partial (~67/115 at ~58% pass rate) is an **interrupted estimate, not a
measured result**. Treat the first-20 `0.75` as the only hard data point until the full
rerun completes. HumanEval's back half is materially harder; the real full-set figure is
likely well below `0.75` but is pending measurement.

> **Status (2026-06-22):** harvest + execution-verify + promote-gate **built, run, and
> tested** (adversarially reviewed — loop-breaking and data-quality findings fixed; the
> crash-safe promote swap is unit-tested incl. forced mid-swap failure → rollback).
> Full-HumanEval rerun of `final/` (`ouro-final-rerun-full`) **did not complete** — the

> A 600-step combined adapter training run was started 2026-06-22 ~06:29 (est. ~6.3 hr);
> the eval + promote-gate have **not** been run against the resulting adapter yet.

> **Next required steps (see [#911](https://github.com/alex-place/lantern-os/issues/911)):**
> stop `ouro_serve.py` to free the GPU, then run:
> ```
> continual_ouro_pipeline.py --eval --promote --full --candidate <new-adapter-path>
> ```
> This will re-evaluate the incumbent live, compare against the candidate, and — if the

## Cloud GPU Rotation Orchestrator (2026-06-22)

The local RTX 3070 (8GB VRAM) runs at seq=1536 in ~38 sec/step but is single-process — it
can't train while serving Ouro. To decouple training from the live session, all cloud
training now goes through a **provider rotation system** in `routes/gpu-training.js` and
`lib/training-dispatcher.js`, configured by `data/pcsf/gpu-training.pcsf.json`.

### Providers (rotation order, most to least preferred)

| Provider | GPU | VRAM | Quota | Automatable | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Kaggle** | T4 / P100 | 16 GB | 30 h/wk | Yes (REST kernel push) | Active |
| **SageMaker Studio Lab** | T4 | 16 GB | 28 h/wk | Manual | Next up |
| **Google Colab** | T4 | 15 GB | 22 h/wk | Manual (notebook emit) | Available |
| **Lightning AI** | T4 / A10 | 16–24 GB | 22 h/wk | Yes (lightning-sdk) | Available |
| **Local RTX 3070** | RTX 3070 | 8 GB | Unlimited | Yes | Available when idle |
| Paperspace | M4000 | 8 GB | 0 h/wk | Yes | PRO required ($8/mo) |

**Total free cloud quota: 102 h/wk.**

### API endpoints

```
GET  /api/gpu-training/status     — providers + last 20 jobs + active job + next provider
GET  /api/gpu-training/providers  — PCSF config
POST /api/gpu-training/dispatch   — { provider?, steps?, checkpointUri? }
POST /api/gpu-training/poll       — { provider, jobId }
POST /api/gpu-training/test       — smoke-test credential resolution (no GPU spin-up)
GET  /api/gpu-training/keys       — credential status (masked)
POST /api/gpu-training/keys       — { key, value } — set + persist to Windows User env
```

The UI (Dashboard / `orchestration.html`) wraps these endpoints with a provider card grid,
a dispatch form, and a live job log.

### Training job log (as of 2026-06-23)

| Time (UTC) | Provider | Job | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-22 22:14 | Colab | ouro-training-1782166464438 | `manual_required` | Notebook emitted; awaiting manual launch |
| 2026-06-22 22:14 | Kaggle | ouro-training-test | `done` | Smoke-test — no training run |
| 2026-06-22 22:45 | Kaggle | ouro-training-600-steps | `running` (last poll) | Polled once as running; no completion record — likely session expired |
| 2026-06-22 23:40 | Kaggle | ouro-training-202606222340-600-steps | **`failed`** | rawStatus: `error`; polled 00:19 UTC; no failure message returned by Kaggle API |

**Root cause of Kaggle failure (likely):** the kernel title slug mismatch logged in `cliOutput`
(`"Your kernel title does not resolve to the specified id"`) suggests the kernel was pushed
but Kaggle's scheduler rejected it before it ran. The training script itself was not the
issue — the kernel push/title resolution needs fixing in `training-dispatcher.js`.

**Next action:** SageMaker is next in rotation (manual launch). Open
`https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/`, start a GPU runtime, paste the notebook template from
the next dispatch record, run all cells.

### Convergence record implication

Every dispatch + poll is written to `data/self-improvement/training-jobs.jsonl`. Every
model interaction in dream-chat now also writes a convergence record to
`data/convergence/records.jsonl` (implemented 2026-06-22, PR #1066). Failures are logged
with `priority: HIGH` and `confidence: 0.1` for audit.
