# Keystone-Σ₀ PLT — Handoff (2026-07-01)

**What this is:** the pick-up sheet for the "loopcoder swap" — bootstrapping our own
proprietary Σ₀ coder ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-proprietary-sigma0-base-model.md))
from the Apache-2.0 LoopCoder-V2 Parallel Loop Transformer. Read the [README](../models/keystone-sigma0-plt/README.md)
for the architecture; this doc is **only what's left to do and how**.

---

## TL;DR

The owned PLT is now the **sole local coder** (leads coding/reasoning/default in
`local-model-registry.js`, served on `:11435`), loads 4-bit (~6.4 GB), and decodes at
~7.8 tok/s with the KV cache. But it is **`verified:false`** — it leads because it's the
*only* local coder, **not** because it won an eval. The two real gates are still open and
both need a **≥24 GB GPU** (not available on the 8 GB dev box): **faithful parity** and the
**eval win vs a frontier coder**.

## State of play (verified 2026-07-01)

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Own the modeling code | ✅ done | `modeling_keystone_plt.py`, merged PR #1645 |
| Stage-0 smoke — loads + generates | ✅ PASS | 4-bit, missing=0/unexpected=0, 2/3 coherent — `data/convergence/keystone-plt-parity-log.jsonl` |
| Speed — interactive-usable | ✅ BUILD | KV cache 4.29 → 7.83 tok/s (static), PR #1766. Locked by `tests/test_keystone_plt_kv_cache.py` |
| Serving + registry entry | ✅ landed | `serve_keystone_plt.py` (:11435) + sole-coder registry entry, #1758 |
| **Faithful parity (top1≥0.99 vs vLLM)** | ⛔ **PENDING** | needs ≥24 GB — `parity: null` in the log |
| Eval win vs frontier coder | ⛔ pending | the gate to flip `verified:true` — not run |
| `verified:true` (earned lead) | ⛔ no | gated on parity **and** eval win (External Reality Rule) |
| ADR-0011 founder decision | ⛔ Proposed | `#1666` — only Alex flips it |

> **⚠️ Regression watch:** PR #1766's KV cache was silently reverted once by a stale

> re-restored on 2026-07-01. If decode speed suddenly drops back to ~4 tok/s, check

## What needs to be done now (priority order)

### P0 · Faithful parity — the one blocking gate
Run the definitive check on a **≥24 GB** GPU (Colab L4/A100). This proves the hand-written
forward matches the trained weights.
```bash
# on a >=24GB box (or open models/keystone-sigma0-plt/colab_parity.ipynb)
python download_and_patch.py --out ./checkpoint          # ~18 GB, one time
# capture a vendor reference (vLLM fork yxing-bj/vllm): fixed input_ids -> ref_logits.pt
python check_parity.py --model ./checkpoint --dtype bf16 --ref ref_logits.pt   # want top1_agree >= 0.99
```
- **If it fails**, try the 3 reconstructed boundaries (commented in `modeling_keystone_plt.py`):
  (1) CLP shift `plt_clp_shift`, (2) sliding-window off-by-one, (3) per-loop norm placement.
- Tracked in [#1743](https://github.com/alex-place/lantern-os/issues/1743).

### P1 · Eval win vs a frontier coder — flips `verified:true`
```bash
python models/keystone-sigma0-plt/serve_keystone_plt.py   # serves on :11435
$env:KEYSTONE_PLT_ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:11435"
python scripts/eval_humaneval_chat.py                     # head-to-head
```
On a win: set `verified: true` + the **measured** `capabilityScore` on the
`keystone-sigma0-plt` entry. Tracked in #1743 (Stage 2).

### P1 · Trained Adaptive Loop Gate — the real capability/speed lever
Naively cutting to 1 loop hits 8.69 tok/s but **0/3 coherent** — a blunt cut destroys
quality. The headroom needs a *trained* halt gate ([ADAPTIVE-LOOP-GATE.md](../models/keystone-sigma0-plt/ADAPTIVE-LOOP-GATE.md),
adapter-only on a frozen base, default-off). Needs parity first, then GPU training via
`train_lora.py`. Tracked in #1743 (Stage 1).

### Deferred · T2/T3 speed (torchao int4 + torch.compile)
`torch.compile` doesn't help under bnb-nf4 (6.65 < 7.83); the compile win needs torchao
int4, **blocked on this Windows env** (installing torchao breaks `trust_remote_code`
loading). Needs a separate newer-torch env or a ≥24 GB Linux box. Not blocking — the static
cache already clears BUILD. Tracked in [#1771](https://github.com/alex-place/lantern-os/issues/1771).

### Gate · ADR-0011 founder decision (#1666)
Alex's call, now with BUILD + serving + sole-coder evidence. Agents leave it `Proposed`.

## The finish line

`verified:true` requires: **parity PASS on 24 GB → eval win vs a frontier coder → flip the
registry entry**. Until then it's the sole local coder by operator choice — a hand-served
model that leads by default, not a reproduced-capability lead.
