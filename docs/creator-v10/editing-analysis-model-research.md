# Editing & Analysis Model Research — Improvement Plan

**Status:** research (no code committed beyond this doc)
**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Scope:** concrete, implementable improvements to the two model families behind the
creator dashboard — the **analysis model** (perception: what's in the clip) and the
**editing model** (decision: how to cut/order it). Grounded in the current code and
in current short-form/highlight-detection methods. Builds on
[learning-pipeline-research.md](learning-pipeline-research.md) and the shipped
analytics-calibration module.

Every improvement here obeys the project's two non-negotiables: **no fabricated
metrics** (External Reality Rule) and **one loop, not a parallel engine** — each item
strengthens Observe/Reason/Verify, it does not add a new subsystem.

---

## A. Analysis model (perception)

### Current mechanism (verified in code)
`apps/lantern-garage/lib/highlight-engine.js` runs three ffmpeg passes (motion,
audio loudness, scene difference) over the operator's own clip and merges them into a
`HighlightTimeline`. `viral-score-v10.js → deriveSignals()` then turns that timeline
into the signals the scorer uses.

### Weaknesses (honest)
1. **"Cuts" are not cuts.** `deriveSignals` computes `cutsPerMin = highlights.length / durationMin`
   (`viral-score-v10.js:45`). That's *number of detected highlights*, not the clip's
   real shot-boundary rate. Pacing, retention, and caption-potential all lean on this
   proxy.
2. **Highlight selection is a hand-tuned composite** (gameplay-first weighting). It has
   no notion of *novelty* or *recurrence* — a loud-but-boring repeated moment scores
   like a genuinely surprising one.
3. **No speech understanding.** Hook *type*, CTA placement, and caption density are
   inferred from audio energy, not from what is actually said.
4. **No outcome grounding.** Signals are never checked against where viewers actually
   drop off.

### Improvements

**A1 — Real shot-boundary detection (measured `cutsPerMin`).**
Replace the highlight-count proxy with true shot boundaries. PySceneDetect's
`AdaptiveDetector` (rolling average of HSV frame differences) is the right choice for
gaming's fast motion; `ContentDetector` for talking-head. Best practice from the
project itself applies: *tune the threshold against your own samples* (generate the
stats file, don't trust the default 30 — ~27 is a better starting point). Output: a
measured `cutsPerMin`, `avgShotLengthSec`, and shot-length variance, all with
`own_render` provenance so the calibration set and `score-engine` `FEATURE_KEYS` get a
*real* number instead of a proxy. No new heavy dependency is strictly required — an
honest first cut can reuse the ffmpeg `select='gt(scene,...)'` scores already in the
pipeline; PySceneDetect is the accuracy upgrade.

**A2 — Unsupervised audio-visual recurrence for highlight scoring.**
Current SOTA for *label-free* highlight detection scores moments by how much they
stand out from the rest of the same video (and from a cluster of similar videos) —
"audio-visual recurrence." This fits the honesty rule perfectly: it is
**self-supervised on the user's own clip**, inventing no external labels. Concretely:
embed short windows (audio + visual), score each window by its distance from the
clip's typical window; surprising = far. This replaces "max(motion, audio, scene)"
with a novelty signal and directly attacks weakness #2. Start cheap (per-window
feature distance), upgrade to learned embeddings (VideoMAE/CLIP + audio) later.

**A3 — Speech layer (Whisper) → measured hook/CTA/caption features.**
Transcribe with Whisper; derive *measured* features: hook style (question / claim /
countdown) from the first-window text, CTA presence + timestamp, words-per-second
(true caption density), and silence gaps ("dead air" to cut). This is Layer 2 from the
pipeline research, and it converts three currently-faked features into real ones.

**A4 — Retention-curve alignment (the highest-leverage item).**
The analytics calibration set now exists. YouTube/TikTok expose a **second-by-second
retention curve**, and the platform's own ranking signal is *intro retention* (% past
3 s, target > 70%) and *% viewed*, not total watch time. So: ingest the retention
curve, align it to the edit timeline, and attribute **drop-off cliffs to the specific
edit at that timestamp**. A healthy curve is a gentle decline; a cliff means "something
happened here." This turns the analysis model from "guess what's good" into "learn,
from your own audience, exactly which edits shed viewers." It plugs straight into the
calibration module as a richer outcome than the single `avgPercentViewed` scalar.

---

## B. Editing model (decision)

### Current mechanism
`variant-engine-v10.js` selects and orders real highlight segments into 5 strategy
variants, each re-scored by `scoreVideoV10` and ranked by viral score. Weights are
heuristic priors in `research/viral_patterns.json` (`calibrated:false`).

### Improvements

**B1 — Hook-first assembly against the > 70% intro-retention target.**
Make the first 1–3 s a hard constraint, not a soft score: the opening segment must be
the strongest *novelty* moment (A2) or a strong spoken hook (A3). Current code rewards
an early event; the change is to *guarantee* a high-intro-retention opener because that
is the single measured lever the algorithm rewards most.

**B2 — Drop-off-aware cutting (needs A4 + calibration).**
Once retention curves are aligned, penalize segment *types* that historically precede
cliffs in the operator's own data, and favor those that hold a flat curve. This is the
editing model consuming the Verify stage — the first genuinely *calibrated* editing
decision, gated behind the same ≥100-outcome threshold as everything else.

**B3 — Curiosity-stacking / open-loop ordering.**
Order segments so each delivers one payoff while opening the next loop, rather than
front-loading all payoffs. Implementable now as an ordering heuristic over the existing
segment scores; validate later via B2.

**B4 — Calibrated re-weighting of the priors.**
Today `viral_patterns.json` weights are fixed guesses. Once `calibration.correlations()`
is calibrated, use the measured feature↔outcome correlations to *re-weight* the
components (with shrinkage toward the priors, never a hard overwrite), and flip
`calibrated:true`. This closes the loop: Observe (A1–A3) → Reason (score/variant) →
Verify (A4/calibration) → Converge (B4).

## Prioritization

| # | Item | Effort | Unblocks | Honesty risk |
|---|------|--------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **A1** real shot boundaries | low (reuse ffmpeg) → med (PySceneDetect) | real `cutsPerMin` everywhere | none |
| 2 | **A4** retention-curve alignment | med | B2, true calibration | none (own data) |
| 3 | **A3** Whisper speech features | med | real hook/CTA/caption | none |
| 4 | **A2** recurrence highlight scoring | med→high | better selection | none (self-supervised) |
| 5 | **B1** hook-first assembly | low | intro-retention gains | none |
| 6 | **B4** calibrated re-weighting | low (after #2) | `calibrated:true` | gated by data |

**Recommended order:** A1 → A4 → A3 → B1 → A2 → B2/B4. A1 and A4 are the foundation:
A1 makes the headline pacing feature real; A4 + the shipped calibration set make the
*editing* decisions answerable to the operator's actual audience instead of priors.

## Validation (consistent with the honesty rule)
- A1: compare measured shot boundaries to a hand-counted sample of the operator's own
  clips (tune threshold on those samples, per PySceneDetect guidance).
- A2/A3/A4: store as `own_render` measured features; they earn trust only when the
  calibration correlations show they track real outcomes — never asserted as predictive
  before that.
- B2/B4: stay behind the existing ≥100-labeled-outcome gate; until then the dashboard
  keeps showing structural estimates labeled "not calibrated."

## Progress log (autonomous research loop)

- **2026-06-19 — A1 DONE (real shot boundaries).** `highlight-engine.js` now aggregates
  the already-detected scene cuts into a measured `shotBoundaries` block
  (`cutsPerMin`, `avgShotLengthSec`, `shotLengthCV`, count, source `ffmpeg_scene_hsv`,
  `measured` flag) via the pure, testable `computeShotMetrics()`. `viral-score-v10.js
  deriveSignals` prefers the measured cut rate when present and flags
  `cutsPerMinMeasured`, falling back to the highlight-count proxy otherwise;
  `avgShotLengthSec` is exposed and added to the calibration feature keys. Tests:
  `tests/test_shot_metrics.js` (8/8) + calibration regression (12/12).
  No new dependency — reuses existing ffmpeg scene detection (PySceneDetect remains the
  future accuracy upgrade). **Next: A4 (retention-curve alignment).**
  *Note:* work moved to an isolated git worktree (`lantern-os-calib`) after the shared
  tree switched branches mid-edit twice.
- **2026-06-19 — A4 DONE (retention-curve alignment).** New
  `retention-curve-import.js` parses a YouTube "Audience retention" CSV into a
  normalized curve (ratio or % auto-detected); `retention-analysis.js` computes the
  metrics the platforms actually reward — intro retention (3s/ratio), mean retention,
  and the steepest drop-off **cliff** — and `attributeCliffToSegments()` maps that
  cliff to the exact edit segment it lands in, so the editing model can learn which
  edits shed viewers. `retentionOutcomeMetrics()` exposes intro/mean/maxCliffDrop as
  numeric outcomes that flow into the calibration correlations; the recommender knows
  a bigger cliff is worse (`maxCliffDrop` not higher-is-better). Exposed via the
  calibration namespace. Tests: `tests/test_retention_curve.js` (10/10) + A1 (8/8) +
  calibration (12/12). Honesty: sparse/unknown curves yield nulls, never guesses.
  **Next: A3 (Whisper speech → measured hook/CTA/caption features).**
- **2026-06-19 — A3 DONE (speech features).** New `apps/lantern-garage/lib/speech-features.js`:
  `parseWhisperJson()` (tolerant of `{segments}` or bare array) + pure
  `deriveSpeechFeatures(segments, durationSec)` → measured `hookStyle`
  (question/countdown/shock/reaction/text), `wordsPerSec` (real caption density),
  `speechCoverage`, CTA presence/timestamp/position, and `deadAirMaxSec` (largest gap
  to cut). `viral-score-v10.js deriveSignals` surfaces these when
  `analysis.metadata.speech.measured`; numeric ones (`wordsPerSec`, `speechCoverage`,
  `deadAirMaxSec`) added to the calibration feature keys. The Whisper invocation is a
  thin `transcribeToSpeechFeatures()` wrapper that honestly returns `measured:false`
  when the CLI/model is absent (not unit-tested). Tests: `tests/test_speech_features.js`
  (6/6) + A1 (8/8) + A4 (10/10) + calibration (12/12). **Next: B1 (hook-first variant
  assembly against the >70% intro-retention target).** *Pipeline wiring note:* the
  analysis job-worker does not yet call `transcribeToSpeechFeatures` to populate
  `metadata.speech` — that integration (+ optional whisper dependency) is the
  remaining glue for A3 to run end-to-end on uploads.
- **2026-06-19 — B1 DONE (hook-first variant assembly).** `variant-engine-v10.js`:
  `maximum_rewatch` previously opened with the WEAKEST segment (ascending) and
  `story_arc` opened with whatever was chronologically first — both tank intro
  retention (the platform's #1 lever). Now rewatch opens with a strong hook AND still
  ends on the single strongest payoff; story_arc is a cold open (strongest first, then
  chronological). retention/excitement/balanced already opened strong. Every variant
  now exposes `introStrength` (the opener's real segment score, 0-1) — a structural
  hook-strength proxy, explicitly NOT a calibrated intro-retention %. Tests:
  `tests/test_variant_hookfirst.js` (5/5) + A1/A4/A3/calibration regressions all green.
  **Next: A2 (unsupervised audio-visual recurrence highlight scoring).**
- **2026-06-19 — A2 DONE (recurrence novelty).** New `apps/lantern-garage/lib/recurrence-novelty.js`:
  `noveltyScores()` scores each time-window by its robust z-distance (median+MAD) from
  the clip's OWN typical window, in the **salient direction only** (a quiet/still window
  is not a highlight). Label-free / self-supervised — replaces "max(motion,audio,scene)"
  so a loud-but-repeated moment no longer scores like a genuinely surprising one.
  `recurrenceHighlights()` merges high-novelty windows into candidate spans;
  `framesToWindows()` bins the existing motion/audio/scene frame series. HONESTY hard
  guarantee (tested): a UNIFORM clip yields zero novelty everywhere — no min-max
  stretching, no manufactured contrast; <4 windows → no scores. Tests:
  `tests/test_recurrence_novelty.js` (6/6) + all prior regressions green.
  *Wiring note:* not yet fused into `mergeDetections` (would add a `novel` tag /
  blend into the gameplay-first composite) — that integration is the remaining glue.
  **Next: B2 (drop-off-aware cutting — needs the A4 retention curves + calibration).**
