## Canon Maintenance Rules

1. **Only add paper/project when it directly informs Convergence 12 components**
2. **Link to specific component (not generic reference)**
3. **Note the implementation status (theory / roadmap / in-progress / done)**
4. **Remove entries when superseded by implementation or better alternative**
5. **This is not a bookmarks list. It is the architecture research trail.**
