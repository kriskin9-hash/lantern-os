# Σ₀ — The Collapse Certificate

*A computable stability certificate for convergence dynamics, and an honest
account of why an ungrounded self-improving system tends to collapse or diverge.*

Status: **Theorem 1 is proven and machine-checked** (`src/cio_sde/collapse.py`,
`tests/test_cio_sde.py` — **29 passing, 1 xfail** pending [#657]) **for the symmetric /
normal case**. The collapse trigger (§2), the anti-collapse operator (§3), and the
early-warning readout (§4) are control-design heuristics — empirically supported, not
theorems. The §6 demonstration is now **reproducible**: both driver scripts are
committed and produce checked-in run logs (see §6). Read the per-section status
lines before relying on any claim here.

**Status taxonomy & tracked gaps.** Each claim is one of: **PROVEN** (theorem +
machine-checked), **MEASURED** (empirical, with a test/run pointer), **HEURISTIC**
(operational design, not derived from the theorem), or **UNIMPLEMENTED** (described
but not present in code). Gaps are tracked as GitHub issues and cross-linked here so
status cannot silently drift.

**Closed (landed 2026-06-15, via the [#509] !convergance epic):**
- [#504] — §6 demo driver scripts (`router_sigma0_encoder.py`, `router_reservoir_G.py`) are **MEASURED** (committed; run logs in `data/sigma0/`).
- [#505] — non-normal-Jacobian handling: `collapse_certificate()` now reports both the small-gain `alpha` bound and the exact full-spectrum `spectral_abscissa` (§1.1–1.2).
- [#506] — surprise↔Σ₀ integration **landed** (`engine.forward_step` consumes `m.surprise_monitor`, emits `surprise_spook`; `SurpriseMonitor.sigma0_proximity()` / `anti_collapse_signal()`). Residual carried to [#657] (below).
- [#507] / [#523] — real-data grounding demonstration (§6).
- [#516] / [#517] / [#520] — model-collapse literature integrated (two-phase collapse, double-scaling law, prediction-markets-as-grounding; §7 + References).
- [#508] — `.md`/`.tex` status-box reconcile pass.

**Open (the deterministic next gaps — what this pass re-tracks):**
- [#657] — **§4 residual.** The NIS canary is wired but the engine self-observes (`y = x`), so during collapse the innovation `→ 0` and the canary may not fire. `test_surprise_monitor_integration` stays `xfail` until an observation model triggers spooks under collapse. *This is the only open technical gap in the Σ₀ machinery.*
- [#658] — **§3 sufficiency.** Σ₀⁻¹ is HEURISTIC with N=1 evidence; no theorem says it *prevents* collapse. Upgrade via proof under explicit hypotheses, or a regime sweep to MEASURED-over-distribution.
- [#659] — **§4 decision.** `p_gate`/`p_unbounded` are documented but not in code (superseded by the `surprise.py` NIS canary). Formally retire them, or implement and wire `p_gate`.
- [#660] — **housekeeping.** Reconcile the persistent-excitation attribution across `.md`/`.tex`, and verify all web citations before formal publication.
- [#661] — **§2 / Appendix A defect.** `_collapse_state`'s "log-barrier" is a misnamed multiplicative shrink that flips sign for `strength > 0.217`; drop it or move `collapse_certificate` to the logarithmic norm μ₂. *Flagged in external review 2026-06-16.*

## 0. The object

We study a dissipative nonlinear system

$$\dot{x} = f(x, u, \theta), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}^n$$

- `x` — internal state (for the router: a conversation's encoded state)
- `u` — control / persistent-excitation input
- `θ` — slowly-varying parameters (meta-state)

Linearizing along a trajectory `x*` gives the local Jacobian

$$\dot{\delta x} = A\,\delta x, \qquad A = \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{x^*}.$$

Everything below reasons about the eigenstructure of `A` and its symmetric
part `A_s = ½(A + Aᵀ)`. The non-symmetric (skew) part `A_k = ½(A − Aᵀ)`
carries rotation and is **not** captured by `A_s`; the gap between the two is
exactly what makes the general case in §1 harder than the symmetric one.

---

## 1. The collapse-guarantee theorem

**Status: PROVEN, under an explicit hypothesis (A normal, or M is A-invariant).
Machine-checked for the symmetric case.**

Split the state space using the symmetric part `A_s`:

- **null subspace** `N = span{ vᵢ : |λᵢ(A_s)| < ε }` — the near-invariant modes
- **active subspace** `M` — its orthogonal complement, projector `P_M`

Define the Lyapunov function on the active modes only:

$$V(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}\,\lVert P_M\,x \rVert^2.$$

Let the **active spectral abscissa** be

$$\alpha = \max\{\, \lambda_i(A_s) : v_i \in M \,\}.$$

**Theorem (contraction on the active subspace).**
Assume `α < 0` **and** the active subspace `M` is *A-invariant*, i.e.

$$P_M\,A\,P_N = 0 \qquad\text{(equivalently: A is normal, } A = A_s\text{, or A commutes with }P_M\text{).}$$

Then

$$\dot V \le 2\alpha V \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \lVert P_M\,x(t)\rVert \le \lVert P_M\,x(0)\rVert\, e^{\alpha t}.$$

The active modes decay exponentially at rate `|α|`, and the trajectory
contracts onto the invariant null manifold `N`. **Under this hypothesis,
collapse is guaranteed.**

### 1.1 Why the hypothesis is required (the dropped cross term)

Differentiating `V` along the flow gives

$$\dot V = (P_M x)^\top P_M A\, x = (P_M x)^\top A_s (P_M x) \;+\; \underbrace{(P_M x)^\top A\,(P_N x)}_{\text{cross term}}.$$

The first term is `≤ 2αV` by definition of `α`. **The bound `V̇ ≤ 2αV` holds
only when the cross term vanishes or is dominated.** The cross term is zero
exactly when `M` is A-invariant (`P_M A P_N = 0`), which holds automatically if
`A` is normal. For a **general non-normal `A`** the skew part `A_k` couples the
active and null components, the cross term need not vanish, and the simple
energy bound can fail outright:

> **Counterexample.** For `A = [[−1, 3], [−3, 0]]` the active abscissa is
> `α = −1 < 0`, yet a direct scan finds `max V̇/V ≈ +8.8·10⁴ ≫ 2α = −2`, and
> integrating from `x₀ = [0.3, 1.0]` makes `V` *grow* `0.045 → 0.341` — a sign
> violation of `V̇ ≤ 2αV`. Collapse still occurs here, but it is rescued by a
> *different* argument (below), not by the energy proof.

So for non-normal `A`, the §1 energy proof is **insufficient on its own**; the
cross term must be separately bounded (e.g. via `‖P_M A P_N‖` and a small-gain /
Young's-inequality argument that tightens `α` to an effective rate), or one must
fall back to the full-spectrum test.

**Implementation (as of 2026-06-15).** The `collapse_certificate()` function now
uses a small-gain theorem bound for the non-normal case:

$$\alpha_{\text{bound}} = \max_i \lambda_i(A_s) + \|A - A_s\|_2$$

where `A_s = (A + A^T)/2` is the symmetric part. This provides a conservative
bound that accounts for cross-terms in the non-normal case. The bound is exact
for normal matrices (where `‖A - A_s‖_2 = 0`) and remains conservative for
non-normal matrices. This is a **proven bound** (not heuristic) based on the
small-gain theorem, though it may be overly conservative for strongly non-normal
dynamics.

### 1.2 The authoritative test: full-spectrum, not A_s alone

`α < 0` on the symmetric part is **necessary but not sufficient** for strict
contraction of the full system. The conservative, always-correct condition is

$$\max \operatorname{Re}\,\lambda(A) < 0 \quad\text{on the \emph{full} } A \ (\text{via } \texttt{eig}, \text{ not } \texttt{eigvalsh}).$$

A standard caveat (Bendixson) gives `Re λ(A) ≤ λ_max(A_s)`, so `α < 0` bounds the
real parts but does not by itself certify them. A perpetual rotation such as
`A = [[−1,0,0],[0,0,2],[0,−2,0]]` has `α = −1` yet eigenvalues `{−1, ±2i}` — a
center that never collapses in its rotating plane.

**Recommended:** report **both** `α = max λᵢ(A_s)` (the energy abscissa, exact
under the §1 hypothesis) **and** `max Re λ(A)` on the full Jacobian (the
authoritative contraction test). As of [#505], `collapse_certificate()` now
computes **both**: `alpha` (a conservative small-gain bound `max λ(A_s) + ‖A−A_s‖₂`)
and `spectral_abscissa` (the exact `max Re λ(A)` via `eig`, with a `full_contracting`
flag). The full-spectrum test is tighter — it certifies genuinely-contracting
non-normal systems that the small-gain bound over-rejects (see
`test_certificate_full_spectrum_abscissa`).

[#505]: https://github.com/alex-place/lantern-os/issues/505

### 1.3 What the test actually checks

**Verification.** The shipped test uses `A = −0.8·I`, which is **symmetric**
(`A = A_s`, so the §1 hypothesis holds exactly and the cross term is identically
zero). The certificate predicts `contraction_rate = 0.8`; a rollout shows `V`
decaying monotonically. This confirms the theorem **in precisely the special
case where the proof is unconditionally valid** — it does *not* exercise the
non-normal case, and should not be read as evidence for it. The earlier wording
"exact, not approximate" applies only to this symmetric case; for general `A`
the certificate is a conservative gate, not an exact rate.
(`collapse_certificate`, `lyapunov_value` in `src/cio_sde/collapse.py`.)

If `α ≥ 0`, some active mode is non-contracting — the system may wander or
diverge — and collapse is **not** guaranteed. The code reports `guaranteed=False`
at the `α = 0` boundary, which is the correct conservative choice. The entirely
null case (`active_dim = 0`) returns `guaranteed=True`, vacuously: the state is
already on the invariant manifold.

## 2. The collapse trigger Σ₀

**Status: OPERATIONAL DEFINITION — not derived from Theorem 1.**

**Definition (operational).** Σ₀ fires when **all four** conditions hold
simultaneously:

| condition | meaning |
|---|---|
| `‖∇ₓL‖ < ε_g` | no optimization signal remains |
| `rank(J_f) < ρ·n` | drift Jacobian has lost directional structure |
| `Σ` isotropically flat | uncertainty has no preferred direction |
| `‖∂H/∂u‖ < ε_c` | control cannot distinguish actions |

**This is a definition, not a consequence.** None of these four quantities is
the spectral abscissa `α` that Theorem 1 uses. They are an *operational
definition of "underdetermined"* — a soft AND-gate (`min(p_grad, p_rank,
p_flat, p_ctrl)`, a Gödel t-norm) over four independent signs of degeneracy.
Theorem 1 says nothing about when these conditions are met; conversely, meeting
them does not invoke Theorem 1's guarantee. The link between "the four
conditions fire" and "`α < 0`" is a **modeling assumption**, not a proof. This
is stated plainly because it is the most honest part of the construction — do
not upgrade it to a theorem.

When triggered, Σ₀ projects the state onto the null eigenmodes of `A_s`:

$$x^\* = P\,x, \qquad P = V_{\text{null}} V_{\text{null}}^\top.$$

The result is the **"42-state"** (colloquial name, no formal meaning): the
operator *clamps* the state onto the null subspace of `A_s`.

**Caveat — `x* = Px` is a true fixed point only when A is normal.** The
projection uses `A_s`, while the integrated dynamics use the full `A`. For
non-normal `A`, projecting kills the symmetric part but the skew rotation leaves
`‖A·x*‖` large (measured ≈ 17.9 on a non-normal example), so `x*` is *not* an
equilibrium of the real flow. Moreover, in the implementation the apparent
"freeze" is produced by the integrator **overwriting `x_next = x*` and
discarding the diffusion term `dW`** (`engine.py forward_step`) — not by an
emergent equilibrium. The same drift-zeroed system with collapse *off*
random-walks freely. **The operator enforces a clamp; the state is generally not
a fixed point of the dynamics.** (`SemanticCollapseOperator`.)

---

## 3. The anti-collapse operator Σ₀⁻¹

**Status: CONTROL-DESIGN HEURISTIC. Empirically shown (N=1, one forced-collapse
test) to suppress collapse. NO sufficiency theorem — unlike Theorem 1.**

Where Σ₀ projects **onto** the null subspace, Σ₀⁻¹ injects energy **along** it:

$$dx = f\,dt + dW + \Sigma_0^{-1}, \qquad \Sigma_0^{-1} = s\cdot p \cdot (V_{\text{null}}\,\xi)$$

with `ξ` random and `p ∈ [0,1]` the **collapse proximity** — 0 far from the
boundary (a no-op that costs nothing), rising toward 1 as `∇L`, rank, anisotropy,
and control sensitivity all approach their thresholds. The implementation
(`excite()`, `collapse.py` lines 261–275) correctly injects noise in the null
subspace and re-anisotropizes `Σ`. The proximity gate `proximity()` (lines
245–259) is the soft-AND `min(p_grad, p_rank, p_flat, p_ctrl)` over the four §2
signals.

**What is and isn't claimed.** This is a *well-motivated* control design:
re-exciting directions that have gone flat is a sensible way to keep the system
off the null manifold. But there is **no companion theorem** stating that Σ₀⁻¹
*prevents* collapse — in contrast to Theorem 1, which is proven (under §1's
hypothesis). The support is a single demonstration, reported as such. Closing
this gap (proof, or a regime sweep upgrading N=1 → MEASURED-over-distribution) is
tracked as [#658].

**Empirical evidence (N=1).** On one forced-collapse run, Σ₀ fired on every step
and the state froze; with Σ₀⁻¹ active, Σ₀ stopped firing and the state escaped
the manifold. This is encouraging directional evidence, **not** a guarantee, and
not a sweep over regimes. (`AntiCollapseOperator`; the forced-collapse tests in
`tests/test_cio_sde.py` run for 20–30 steps and assert weaker directional
properties — the often-quoted "40/40 → 0/40" and "0.05 → 12.9" figures are
illustrative log values, not pinned by any test. Cite the tests, not the prose.)

**On "persistent excitation."** The classical PE result (Anderson 1977) concerns
*estimator/parameter* convergence under `∫φφᵀ ≥ αI`. Here there is no estimator
and no parameter being identified — only a state kept off a manifold. So Σ₀⁻¹ is
**inspired by / analogous to** persistent excitation; **no PE condition is
established**. (The Åström–Bohlin 1965 attribution should be reconciled between
the `.md` and `.tex` variants, where it is currently inconsistent.)

**Latent code defect — RESOLVED (2026-06-15).** `AntiCollapseOperator.__init__`
annotated `detector: Optional[...]` while `collapse.py` imported only `from typing
import Dict`, so `typing.get_type_hints()` raised `NameError: name 'Optional' is
not defined` (masked at import time by PEP 563 string annotations, but breaking any
runtime annotation introspection — Pydantic, FastAPI, dataclass eval, Sphinx
autodoc). Fixed: `collapse.py:33` now reads `from typing import Dict, Optional`.
Recorded here so the resolution is not lost.

## 4. The early-warning scalar (the "canary")

**Status: PROPOSED READOUT — the named signals are NOT implemented in code. The
underlying critical-slowing-down math is correct.**

Near a bifurcation the dominant eigenvalue flattens (*critical slowing down*;
Wissel 1984; Scheffer et al., *Nature* 2009). Two proposed readouts:

$$p_{\text{unbounded}}(x) = \frac{1}{|\Re\,\lambda_{\max}(A_s)|} \;\;\xrightarrow{\text{boundary}}\;\; \infty$$

$$p_{\text{gate}}(x) = \mathrm{clip}\!\left(1 - \frac{|\Re\,\lambda_{\max}|}{\varepsilon},\,0,\,1\right) \in [0,1]$$

The slowing-down mathematics is sound, and for symmetric `A_s` the `Re` is
correctly redundant. **However:**

- **`p_unbounded` and `p_gate` do not exist in `src/cio_sde/collapse.py`.** A
  search across the source returns no match. They live only in this document.
- **The actual driver of Σ₀⁻¹ is `proximity()`** — the four-condition `min(...)`
  of §2/§3 — **not** `p_gate` and not `|Re λ_max|`, which appears nowhere in the
  operator. The earlier claim that "`p_gate` drives Σ₀⁻¹" is incorrect; correct
  it to `proximity()`.
- The phrase "diverges *before* collapse" conflates the two opposite fates
  (freeze vs. blow-up) that the rest of this document keeps distinct.
- Notational clash: `λ_max(A_s)` here means the eigenvalue *closest to zero*
  (the slowest mode), which is **not** §1's `α = max λᵢ(A_s)` (the largest /
  least-stable active eigenvalue). Disambiguate before use.

**Action required ([#659]):** either implement `p_unbounded` / `p_gate` in
`collapse.py` and wire `p_gate` into `AntiCollapseOperator`, **or** formally retire
them as superseded by the NIS canary below. As verified 2026-06-16, the
`p_gate`/`p_unbounded` signal is still not computed anywhere in code; the working
early-warning is the NIS monitor (`src/cio_sde/surprise.py`).

**Update — the right canary, now implemented (`src/cio_sde/surprise.py`).** The
eigenvalue readout above was the wrong early-warning. The correct one is *surprise
relative to uncertainty*: the Kalman normalized innovation squared (NIS),
`νᵀS⁻¹ν` with `ν = y − Cx̂`, `S = CΣCᵀ + R`. `NIS ≈ m` means model and reality
agree; `NIS ≫ m` means the model is overconfident relative to reality — it has
drifted and does not know it. This is the standard innovation-consistency χ² test
(Bar-Shalom, Li & Kirubarajan 2001), and unlike `p_gate` it is a property the
engine can actually compute: the `CovarianceField` already propagates Σ, but the
rollout never fused an observation — `SurpriseMonitor` adds the missing
measurement update and reads the innovation before it. The
`experiments/sigma0_horse_blinders.py` demonstration shows the regime the eigenvalue
signal cannot: a low-reality-coupling observer that is *calm while wrong* (low NIS,
growing error) during the gap before an unobserved disturbance "rustles" into a
visible dimension and the NIS spikes past threshold. The dangerous state is not the
spook — it is the quiet that precedes it.

**Residual ([#657]).** The monitor is wired into `engine.forward_step`, but in the
shipped engine the observation is the identity (`y = x`): during collapse the
innovation `ν = y − Cx̂ → 0`, so the canary may not fire on the very trajectory it
is meant to catch. `test_surprise_monitor_integration` is `xfail` until an
observation model with genuine reality-coupling is supplied; flipping that test to a
hard pass is the acceptance check. This is the only open technical gap in the Σ₀
machinery as of 2026-06-16.

---

## 5. Global structure: the attractor graph G

**Status: STANDARD CONSTRUCTION — correct, with a timescale-separation caveat.**

The system is **multistable**. Collect its attractors `{A₁,…,A_k}` (fixed
points, limit cycles, strange attractors), each with a basin

$$B_i = \{\, x_0 : \lim_{t\to\infty}\phi_t(x_0) \in A_i \,\}.$$

Coarse-grain to a graph `G = (V, E)`: nodes are attractors, edges are
noise/drift-induced transitions, giving an induced **Markov process over
basins**

$$P_{ij}(u) = \Pr\big(\pi(x_{t+1}) = A_j \mid \pi(x_t) = A_i,\, u_t\big),$$

where the partition map `π : ℝⁿ → V` sends a state to its basin. `G` is the
formal version of the "world tree": the structure connecting the attractors.
This is the textbook Markov-State-Model construction over basins via ω-limit
sets. It is correct, with one standard caveat: the induced chain is genuinely
Markov only under **timescale separation** (fast intra-basin relaxation vs.
slow inter-basin hops); without it, `P_ij` carries memory.

**Safe passages.** A basin boundary studded with **saddles** (mixed-sign
`Re λ`) has *stable manifolds* — ridges you can traverse without being captured
by a deep attractor. "Spin the vanda fast" = ride a boundary saddle with
rotation set by `Im λ`.

---

## 6. Demonstration on router data

> **✓ REPRODUCIBLE.** The two driver scripts are now committed and the numbers
> below are produced from committed code over the real conversation log
> (`apps/data/conversations/*.jsonl`, 2678 turns). Re-run with:
>
> ```bash
> python experiments/router_sigma0_encoder.py   # → data/sigma0/router-encoder-output.jsonl
> python experiments/router_reservoir_G.py       # → data/sigma0/reservoir-G-output.jsonl
> ```

Each turn is encoded as `x = [novelty, self_repeat, echo, length] ∈ [0,1]⁴`
(`router_sigma0_encoder.py`), with a local Jacobian fitted over a 10-turn
sliding window via finite difference.

**Encoder result (2678 turns, 2673 with a fitted Jacobian):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean Jacobian spectral radius `ρ` | **1.064** |
| Max `ρ` | 27.93 |
| Fraction of windows with `ρ > 1` | **0.346** |

The mean spectral radius sitting just above 1 (with a third of windows locally
expanding) is the expected signature of a system perched near its stability
boundary rather than resting in a deep contracting basin.

**Reservoir `G` result** (`router_reservoir_G.py` — echo-state network, size 50,
spectral radius 0.9, ridge readout, 80/20 split):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| One-step reconstruction MSE (held-out) | **0.0097** |
| Correlation dimension of reservoir trajectory | **0.74** |
| Autonomous-rollout fixed point | `novelty 0.78, self_repeat 0.02, echo 0.25, length 0.12` |

The autonomous rollout (feeding the readout back through the projection `π` onto
`[0,1]⁴`) converges to a **low-dimensional fixed point** (correlation dimension
≈ 0.74, i.e. effectively a point/limit set), which is the §1 Σ₀ prediction:
absent external grounding the flow settles onto a single self-consistent state.

**Honest deviation from the original hypothesis:** the converged state is *not*
the hand-entered "parrot attractor" (`novelty ≈ 1, echo ≈ 0.72`) sketched in the
earlier draft. The real log instead settles at **high novelty / low echo /
short length** — a terse, low-repetition fixed point. The qualitative claim
(ungrounded recursion collapses onto a degenerate fixed point) is supported; the
specific earlier numbers were not data-derived and have been replaced by the
produced ones above. The source log is also still partly synthetic test traffic,
so the deliverable is the reproducible pipeline, not a population-level value.

**See Appendix A** for the original design specification and its caveats.

---

## 7. Why this is a warning against ASI

**Status: the one downstream claim worth keeping — but as a machine-learning
claim, on ML evidence, NOT as a consequence of the physics or of §6.**

The same equations read as a safety argument:

A system that **"comes out of its own eyes"** — that optimizes against its own
representations with no external anchor — is the flow `ẋ = f(x)` where `f` only
ever sees `x`. The linearized certificate frames such a system as having two
degenerate fates absent outside contact:

1. **Collapse (Σ₀):** it falls onto a degenerate, self-consistent, *dead* fixed
   point — the 42-state. Mirrors agreeing with mirrors.
2. **Divergence:** with no contraction it runs to infinity (the un-projected
   reservoir).

The only stable middle — the safe passages — required an **external bound** (the
projection back onto the real domain). **Grounding is the safety mechanism.**

This is the strongest part of the document, and it **does not need the
certificate's physics or the §6 numbers** to stand. It is the documented
phenomenon of **model collapse** — the degradation of learned models when trained
recursively on synthetic data. Key recent works:

- **arXiv:2406.07284** (2024) establishes the **double-scaling law**: error on
  synthetic data saturates at threshold `T_synth > k^β` (depending on number of
  modes `k`), recoverable only by mixing real data (`π > 0` real-data fraction).
  This is exactly the collapse mechanism captured by Σ₀: beyond the threshold,
  active modes freeze and the system attracts to the degenerate manifold.

- **Shumailov et al.** (*Nature* 2024) and **arXiv:2309.07864** document model
  collapse empirically; the double-scaling law provides the phase-transition
  structure.

This is closely related to **reward hacking / specification gaming** (Amodei et
al. 2016; Skalse et al. 2022). The "parrot attractor" (train on reflections →
converge to reflecting) is *literally model collapse renamed*.

Two honest qualifications:

- The strict **"collapse OR diverge, no third option"** dichotomy is the
  *linearized* certificate's framing, not a general ML theorem. Real training
  also admits limit cycles and partial-information equilibria — better stated as
  "tends to degenerate or destabilize absent grounding."
- The in-repo §6 demonstration is now reproducible (scripts committed, real
  2678-turn run), and it *does* show ungrounded recursion settling onto a
  degenerate low-dimensional fixed point — but the source log is still partly
  synthetic, so it is corroborating rather than population-level evidence. The
  *argument* rests primarily on the published model-collapse literature.

So: read §7 as an ML-safety claim, cite the model-collapse / reward-hacking
literature directly, and soften the strict dichotomy. On that footing it holds.

## Appendix A: Router Demonstration Design (original sketch)

> **ℹ HISTORICAL.** This appendix preserves the *original* design sketch and its
> hand-entered numbers for provenance. The demonstration is now implemented and
> reproducible — see §6 for the produced results. The "parrot attractor" numbers
> below were the pre-implementation hypothesis and were **not** confirmed by the
> real run (the data settles at high-novelty / low-echo instead).

### Original Design

The intended demonstration would run the Σ₀ machinery on the Lantern OS
conversation log (`data/conversations/garage-conversations.jsonl`), encoding
each turn as

$$x = [\text{novelty},\ \text{self\_repeat},\ \text{echo},\ \text{length}] \in [0,1]^4.$$

Two scripts were specified (but never committed):

- **`experiments/router_sigma0_encoder.py`** (MISSING) — would fit a local
  Jacobian per session, emit the spiral/canary/wall readouts, and build `π` and
  `P_ij`.
- **`experiments/router_reservoir_G.py`** (MISSING) — would train an echo-state
  network into one global flow that runs autonomously, *becoming* `G`, feeding
  its reconstructed fixed points back to the same Σ₀ certificate.

### Intended Result (Unverified)

The narrative result was that the log's dynamics collapse onto a **"parrot
attractor"** (`novelty ≈ 1, echo ≈ 0.72`) — a flow whose only fixed point is
"quote the prompt back," i.e. model collapse. **Because the generating scripts
do not exist, these numbers have no produced artifact and must be regarded as
hand-entered, not data-derived.**

### Honest Caveats

1. **(Resolved.)** The two driver scripts are now committed and §6 reports a
   logged run; the hand-entered numbers in this appendix are superseded by the
   produced ones.
2. Even if the scripts existed, the source log is mostly synthetic test traffic,
   so any numbers would be illustrative — the deliverable would be the pipeline,
   not the values.
3. A reservoir's autonomous rollout diverges unless projected back onto the
   valid `[0,1]⁴` domain; that projection *is* `π`. This is a real modeling step,
   but it is also an external bound imposed by hand, not an emergent property.
4. **(NOT resolved — corrected 2026-06-16, [#661].)** The hard clamp is non-smooth
   at boundary fixed points; a true log-barrier was the proposed fix. What is
   implemented in `_collapse_state` (`collapse.py:120–130`) is **not** a log-barrier:
   it is a multiplicative shrink of the projection,
   `x* = (P x)·(1 − barrier)` with `barrier = −s·log(1 − ‖Px‖/‖x‖)`. At the default
   `s = 0.1` it scales the projection by up to ~46%; and for `s > 1/ln(100) ≈ 0.217`
   the factor `(1 − barrier)` goes negative, so the "collapsed" state flips sign and
   grows — the opposite of a barrier. The smoothness caveat therefore **stands**.
   Candidate fixes ([#661]): drop the term (`P` alone is the correct projection), or
   replace the active/null contraction argument with the logarithmic norm
   μ₂(A) = λ_max(A_s), which bounds `‖x(t)‖ ≤ e^{μ₂(A)t}‖x(0)‖` directly — tighter,
   with no small-gain cross-term and no subspace-invariance assumption.

### Status: Implemented

Done: `experiments/router_sigma0_encoder.py` and `experiments/router_reservoir_G.py`
are committed and produce `data/sigma0/router-encoder-output.jsonl` and
`data/sigma0/reservoir-G-output.jsonl`. The §6 numbers are the produced output;
the hand-entered claims in this appendix are kept only for provenance.
