# Keystone Autonomous Test Fleet — Full Buildout Plan

**Status**: Ready to implement  
**Phases**: 6 (Setup → Engine → Scoring → Filing → Observability → Optimization)  
**Est. effort**: 20 PRs, ~2–3 weeks (solo)  
**Integration**: Streams via `/api/dream/autonomous-work` (#527 A1 pattern)  
**Sigma-0 grounding**: Every finding has [claim, evidence, confidence, source]

## Architecture Overview

```
Keystone (agent) 
  ↓ (chat: "test the app")
/api/dream/autonomous-work with task_type: "keystone-test"
  ├─ KeystoneTestEngine (Playwright automation)
  │  ├─ Scenario: home-load, dream-chat-init, form-tests, etc.
  │  └─ Output: Finding[] { screenshot, console-error, network-timing }
  │
  ├─ KeystoneAnalyzer (confidence scoring)
  │  ├─ Heuristic model: High(0.8–1.0) / Medium(0.5–0.79) / Low(0.2–0.49)
  │  └─ Dedup & cluster findings
  │
  └─ IssueFilr (GitHub automation)
     ├─ Generate markdown from ScoredFinding[]
     ├─ Approval gate: "Approve filing? [y/n]"
     └─ File to GitHub with labels [keystone-autonomous], [sigma0-grounded]

## Execution Strategy

**Monoworkstream**: All PRs use `claude/` branch prefix. Open them serially (one at a time per the monoworkstream rule), testing as you go.

**Review pattern**: Each PR should have:
- Test coverage (basic happy-path test in `npm run test:chat` or Playwright smoke test)
- Convergence record demonstrating the phase completed
- No features beyond the current phase (no premature integration)

**Integration checkpoint**: After Phase 3 (#614), you should be able to file a test issue to GitHub. Stop and verify.

**Daily validation**: After Phase 5, Keystone test runs automatically at 03:00 UTC. Watch logs, refine findings.

---

## Sigma-0 Grounding (Non-Negotiable)

Every Finding must include:
```typescript
interface Finding {
  claim: string;                        // e.g., "XSS in image gallery onclick"
  evidence: string[];                   // ["screenshot.png", "console trace", "HTML snippet"]
  sources: { scenario: string; step: number }[];  // reproducible locator
  confidence: number;                   // 0–1
  reproduced: boolean;                  // Did we see it twice+?
}
```

**Filing threshold**: Only file if confidence >= 0.6 (Medium+). Low-confidence findings go into `data/keystone-insights.jsonl` for manual review later.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Phase 0: Scaffolding compiles, routes exist
- [ ] Phase 1: All 8 scenarios run, capture findings
- [ ] Phase 2: Findings score with confidence >= 0.5 on high-priority bugs
- [ ] Phase 3: File a test issue (manual approval), verify on GitHub
- [ ] Phase 4: SSE stream visible in dream-chat.html, convergence record appended
- [ ] Phase 5: "test the app" in dream-chat triggers run automatically
- [ ] Phase 6: Parallel execution < 5s wall-clock, self-test passes

## Known Constraints & Trade-offs

1. **Playwright vs. Puppeteer**: Using Playwright for better multi-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit). Adds @playwright/test dependency.
2. **Confidence model v0**: Heuristic rules only (no ML). Next iteration can add learned weights.
3. **No GUI for finding review yet**: Approval gate is command-line only (will be dream-chat.html panel in #617).
4. **Daily schedule is naive**: Uses setInterval, will be cron-job-based in v1.1.
5. **Screenshots in issues**: Base64-encoded in markdown (larger PRs, but no external image hosting needed).

## Related Issues & Epics

- **#527** (EPIC): Honest Autonomous Chat — umbrella for autonomous-work observability
- **#509** (CLOSED): Sigma-0 gaps — all 5 priority gaps closed
- **#451** (CLOSED): Kalshi Dashboard — trades testing integration (reference for data flow)

**Next step**: Create GitHub issues 601–623 and start Phase 0 PRs.
