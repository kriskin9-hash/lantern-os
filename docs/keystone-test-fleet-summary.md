# Keystone Autonomous Test Fleet — Summary & Quick Start

**Date**: 2026-06-16  
**Status**: Issues created, ready for Phase 0 implementation  
**Total Issues**: 1 EPIC + 23 sub-issues (6 phases)  
**Estimated delivery**: 2–3 weeks (solo developer)

---

## What We Built

A **complete GitHub issue roadmap** for an autonomous testing agent (Keystone) that:

1. **Runs browser automation** (Playwright) against dream-chat.html, home, trader dashboard
2. **Detects bugs** (crashes, missing elements, console errors, security issues)
3. **Scores findings** with Sigma-0 rigor (confidence + evidence + sources)
4. **Files issues** to GitHub automatically with approval gate
5. **Streams all steps** via SSE (fully observable, per #527 A1 pattern)
6. **Persists results** in convergence records (append-only JSONL)
7. **Integrates with Keystone persona** in dream-chat.html ("test the app")
8. **Auto-runs daily** at startup (03:00 UTC)

## Execution Plan

### Week 1: Foundations (Phases 0–2)

```
Day 1–2: Phase 0 (scaffolding)
  - Create KeystoneTestEngine class
  - Create KeystoneAnalyzer class
  - Wire /api/keystone/test-run route
  
Day 3–4: Phase 1 (scenarios)
  - Implement 8 Playwright scenarios
  - Capture screenshots + console errors
  - Test with local server running
  
Day 5: Phase 2 (scoring)
  - Heuristic confidence model
  - Dedup similar findings
  - Auto-categorize by type
```

### Week 2: Integration (Phases 3–4)

```
Day 6–7: Phase 3 (filing)
  - Wire GitHub API
  - Generate issue markdown
  - Approval gate (user confirmation before filing)
  
Day 8–9: Phase 4 (observability)
  - Convergence records (JSONL)
  - SSE streaming into /api/dream/autonomous-work
  - Test panel in dream-chat.html
```

### Week 3: Polish (Phases 5–6)

```
Day 10: Phase 5 (integration)
  - Keystone persona routes "test" messages
  - Daily cron scheduler
  - Error recovery & resilience
  
Day 11–12: Phase 6 (optimization)
  - Parallel scenario execution
  - Self-test harness
  - Documentation update (CLAUDE.md)
```

## Sigma-0 Grounding (Non-Negotiable)

Every Finding must have:

```typescript
interface Finding {
  claim: string;                          // "XSS in image gallery onclick"
  evidence: string[];                     // ["screenshot.png", "console trace"]
  sources: { scenario: string; step: number }[];
  confidence: number;                     // 0–1
  reproduced: boolean;                    // Seen 2+ times?
}
```

**Filing threshold**: confidence >= 0.6 (Medium+) only.  
Low-confidence findings go to `data/keystone-insights.jsonl` for manual review.

## Success Criteria

Each phase has acceptance criteria in its GitHub issue. High-level:

- [ ] **Phase 0**: Scaffolding compiles, routes exist
- [ ] **Phase 1**: 8 scenarios run, capture findings
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Findings score with confidence, sorted by type
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Can file a test issue to GitHub (with approval)
- [ ] **Phase 4**: SSE stream visible in dream-chat.html, convergence record appended
- [ ] **Phase 5**: "test the app" in dream-chat triggers run, daily auto-run active
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Parallel execution < 5s, self-test passes

---

## Constraints & Trade-offs

1. **Playwright vs. Puppeteer**: Playwright chosen for multi-browser support. Adds @playwright/test dependency.
2. **Confidence model v0**: Heuristic rules only (no ML). Can improve later.
3. **No GUI for finding review**: Approval gate is CLI only (#617 adds dream-chat.html panel).
4. **Daily schedule naive**: Uses setInterval, will be cron-based in v1.1.
5. **Screenshots in issues**: Base64-encoded in markdown (larger PRs, no external hosting).

## Next Steps

1. **Read the plan**: [keystone-test-fleet-plan.md](keystone-test-fleet-plan.md)
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b claude/602-keystone-test-engine-scaffold origin/master`
3. **Start Phase 0**: Create `apps/lantern-garage/lib/keystone-test-engine.js` scaffold
4. **Open PR**: Link to #566 (EPIC) and #567 (issue 602)
5. **Test locally**: `npm start` + run scenarios manually
6. **Iterate**: Each phase builds on the previous; test as you go
