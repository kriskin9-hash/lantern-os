# ADR-NNNN: <Title>

## Status

Proposed <!-- Accepted (Alex-approved only) | Superseded by ADR-NNNN | Deprecated -->

## Context

What forces the decision? The problem, the constraints, the relevant North Star rules
(Σ₀ feature gate, External Reality Rule, one-loop / four-objects), and any prior art in
the repo. State the loop stage this touches (Observe / Remember / Reason / Act / Verify /
Converge). Keep it factual — link to real `file:line`, commits, or PRs as evidence.

## Decision

The change we are making, stated in active voice: "We will …". One decision per ADR.

## Consequences

What becomes easier and what becomes harder once this is in effect. Include the costs and
the debt we are knowingly taking on — name it, don't paper over it.

- **Positive:**
- **Negative / trade-offs:**
- **Follow-ups:** <issues/ADRs this spawns>

## Alternatives considered

Each option and why it was rejected. "Do nothing" is a valid alternative — record why it
wasn't enough.
