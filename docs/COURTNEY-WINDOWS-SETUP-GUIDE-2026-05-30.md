## Part 1: Windsurf Installation

### What is Windsurf?
Windsurf is an AI-powered code editor (similar to Cursor or GitHub Copilot) that you'll use to work with Lantern OS code.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download Windsurf**
   - Go to: `https://windsurf.ai`
   - Click "Download" for Windows
   - Run the installer when downloaded

2. **Install Windsurf**
   - Follow the standard Windows installer prompts
   - Choose default installation location
   - Complete the installation

3. **Open Windsurf**
   - Launch Windsurf from Start menu
   - Sign in or create account if prompted
   - You'll use this to open the Lantern OS repository

### Alternative: Use VS Code with Copilot
If Windsurf has issues, you can also use:
- Visual Studio Code: `https://code.visualstudio.com`
- GitHub Copilot extension for AI assistance

### Step 2: Get Lantern OS Files

**Option A: Copy from Alex's Computer (Fastest)**
1. On Alex's computer, navigate to: `d:\tmp\lantern-os\artifacts\`
2. Copy `lantern-desktop-tester-latest.zip` to a USB drive
3. On your computer, extract the zip to a folder (e.g., `C:\LanternOS\`)

**Option B: Download from GitHub (If Release Exists)**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/alex-place/lantern-os/releases`
2. Look for `lantern-desktop-tester-latest.zip`
3. Download and extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\LanternOS\`)

**Option C: Clone Repository (For Full Development)**
1. Install Git: `https://git-scm.com/download/win`
2. Open PowerShell in your chosen folder
3. Run: `git clone https://github.com/alex-place/lantern-os.git`

### First Steps

1. **Explore the Dashboard**
   - Chat interface for asking questions
   - Demo deck explaining what Lantern does

2. **Test Basic Features**
   - Try the chat: "What can Lantern OS do?"
   - Look at the demo deck
   - Check the local/cloud URL map

3. **Safety Rules**
   - NEVER enter: passwords, seed phrases, private keys, card numbers
   - This is a tester build, not production software
   - Don't use for real financial transactions yet
