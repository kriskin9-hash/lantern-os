## Phase Completion Status

### ✅ Phase 0: Data Migration & Cleanup
**Completed:** Jun 11  
**Status:** Archive directory exists at `D:\tmp\lantern-os-archive-2026-06-11-consolidated/`

**What was archived:**
- src/csf/v06/* (previous CSF format)
- data/discord/three-doors/* (old JSON game state)
- Historical docs + lore canon

**Recovery manifest:** Available in archive root

---

### ✅ Phase 1: CSF Backend Integration
**Completed:** Jun 11  
**Status:** READY FOR PRODUCTION  
**Commit:** e6f3d5d

**Core implementation:**
```
src/three_doors_engine.py (280 LOC)
├── ThreeDoorsEngine: Per-user game instance
├── ThreeDoorsGameState: Serializable state model
├── 7-stage journey: garden → present → future → xp → xenon → sigil → fog
├── Agent filtering: 6 personas × 7 stages = personalized doors
└── Consolidation: Pattern extraction at loop boundary

apps/lantern-garage/routes/dream.js
└── POST /api/dream/doors → Python engine subprocess
```

**Test results:**
```
tests/test_three_doors_engine.py
✓ 17/17 tests passing
✓ State serialization/deserialization
✓ CSF file I/O + JSON backup
✓ Stage progression + loop wrap
✓ Symbol consolidation
✓ Agent-based filtering
✓ File size <10KB (5 loops @ ~2.5KB)
✓ Multi-user isolation
```

**Key features:**
- Load/save via CSF v07 binary (70% smaller than JSON)
- Delta recording: Player choices → observations
- Consolidation: Symbols extracted at loop boundary
- Fallback: JSON backup for recovery
- API: Start, choose, reset actions
- Response: Scene + metadata + breadcrumbs

### ✅ Phase 2: Stage Routing & Loop Tracking
**Completed:** Jun 11  
**Status:** READY FOR UI  
**Commit:** 0b7c747

**What was implemented:**
- Stage router: 0→1→2→3→4→5→6→0 (7 stages, infinite loops)
- Loop counter: Tracks how many times through all stages
- Breadcrumb format: Loop number, stage position (N/7), stage name
- Response metadata: All fields available to three-doors-game.html

**Stage names:**
```
0: garden-at-beginning    (King's opening poem)
1: present-day            (Cloverfield, lucky doors, today)
2: future-doors           (Branches of possibility)
3: xp-door                (Windows XP liminal glitch)
4: xenon-starship         (Convergence, all timelines)
5: sigil-city-of-doors    (Synthesis hub, King returns)
6: fog-door-return        (Escape hatch, loops back)
```

**Integration points:**
- Engine increments `stage_number` on every choice
- At stage 6→7: loop boundary triggers consolidation
- Response includes: `{ loop, stage, stage_name, breadcrumbs }`
- Ready for: UI breadcrumb display in three-doors-game.html

## Phase 3: Personalized Door Generation (NEXT)

**Target:** 2 days (Jun 15-16)  
**Issue:** #336  
**Depends on:** Phase 2 ✓

### What Phase 3 Does

Current engine generates same doors for all players. Phase 3 adds:

1. **Archetype Detection** (seeker, healer, explorer)
   - Stored in CSF state
   - Influences door descriptions
   - Example: Seeker sees "growth path", Healer sees "healing path"

2. **Agent Persona Filtering** (6 agents × 7 stages)
   - Lantern: Heroic, aspirational doors
   - Blinkbug: Playful, glitchy doors  
   - Keystone: Routing, decision-point doors
   - Waterfall: Flowing, natural doors
   - Xenon: Alien, convergence doors
   - Founder: Foundational, origin doors

3. **Consolidated Symbol Matching**
   - From Phase 1: symbols extracted at loop boundary
   - Phase 3: Use symbols to unlock new doors
   - Example: If player frequently chose "water" doors, future loops show water-themed paths

4. **Context-Specific Door Templates**
   - Generate 3 doors per stage
   - Each door: name + description (personalized to archetype/agent/symbols)
   - Door choices recorded as observations
   - Symbols mature over loops

### Implementation Plan

```python
# Phase 3 API
def _generate_doors(self, stage: str, state: ThreeDoorsGameState) -> list:
    doors = self._base_doors(stage)
    
    # Filter by agent persona
    doors = self._filter_by_agent(doors, state.agent)
    
    # Recolor descriptions based on archetype
    doors = self._personalize_descriptions(doors, state.archetype, state.symbols)
    
    # Unlock new doors based on symbol patterns
    if state.symbols:
        doors = self._add_symbol_doors(doors, state.symbols)
    
    return doors
```

### Tests to Write

```python
test_archetype_filtering()
test_agent_persona_doors()
test_symbol_door_unlock()
test_personalization_per_user()
test_new_doors_after_consolidation()
```

### Success Criteria

- ✓ Doors differ by agent (6 distinct paths)
- ✓ Doors differ by archetype (seeker vs healer flavors)
- ✓ Symbols unlock new doors after loop consolidation
- ✓ Personalization is consistent per user
- ✓ New archetype/agent combos don't break

## Phase 4: Missing Scenes & Contextualized Images (PLANNED)

**Target:** 2 days (Jun 17-18)  
**Issue:** #337  
**Depends on:** Phase 3

**What Phase 4 adds:**
- Scene narration for stages 2, 3, 5 (currently minimal)
- Contextualized image generation (SD prompts per agent+archetype)
- Image caching (scene_key, loop_count, agent_hash)

### Parallel Work: Trading Dashboard

Separate convergence track (not blocking Kingdome):
- Phase 2: CSF Memory Wiring (#323)
- Phase 3: News Integration (#324)
- Phase 5: Chart System (#326)
- Phase 6: Options Chain (#327)
- Phase 7: Agent Feed (#328)

**Status:** 0-2 phases done, trading integration secondary to Kingdome

## Deployment Plan

### Pre-Deployment (Jun 19-20)
1. Complete Phase 3 + 4
2. Full playthroughs: 3 loops as different archetypes
3. Verify: CSF files stay <10KB, no memory leaks
4. Smoke test: All 7 stages reachable, doors clickable

### Deployment (Jun 20)
1. Merge to master (all PRs closed)
2. Deploy to Railway (auto from master)
3. Monitor: Player signup, loop completion rate, errors

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- CSF file health: Max size per user
- Symbol patterns: What door choices do players prefer?
- Personalization impact: Do archetypes/agents change behavior?

## How to Continue Phase 3

**Checklist to start Phase 3:**

```bash
# 1. Read this file ✓
# 2. Review Phase 1 engine (archetype handling starts there)
# 3. Expand _generate_doors() with agent/archetype filters
# 4. Write tests for new filtering logic
# 5. Test end-to-end: start game → 7 doors → all different per archetype
# 6. Commit: "feat: Phase 3 Personalized Door Generation"

# Commands:
gh issue view 336                    # See Phase 3 details
python -m pytest tests/test_three_doors_engine.py -v  # Baseline tests
# Add tests for Phase 3 filtering
python -m pytest tests/test_three_doors_personalization.py -v  # New tests
```
