"""Seed Alex's two StatusCubes: the ImagniVerse and the Real-World cube.

Two worlds, one shape (the Status Cube / CSF v0.7):

  data/csf/alex-imagniverse.csf  — the symbolic world: Kingdome of Hearts
                                    canon, characters, doors, tesseract
                                    imagery. Seeded from lore + the
                                    D:\\tmp imagesandreports archive.

  data/csf/alex-realworld.csf    — real-world status: flourishing domains
                                    (after VanderWeele's Human Flourishing
                                    Measure + OECD Better Life Index),
                                    each cell backed by evidence classes
                                    observed in the D:\\ archive.

Both .csf files are local-only (gitignored) — they are private state.
Strengths are 0..1 confidence/charge values; `observer` marks which lens
wrote the cell (the cube axes: beliefs x observers).
