# Kingdome of Hearts — Three Doors Lore Expansion

**CSF Ingest Date:** 2026-06-09
**Source:** Founder direct session + Shelby Elephant Door anchor memory + Three Doors runtime canon
**Status:** Design contract with partial implementation

---

> **Note:** This document began as a design contract. PR #303 implements the initial Discord bot scene-graph integration for Kingdome Garden, Storybook, and Cloverfield. Browser game implementation, challenge registry, prizes, poem validation, and durable cross-session progress remain follow-up work.

---

## Overview

The **Kingdome of Hearts** is a new narrative hub in the Three Doors game. It transforms the existing linear scene progression into a **hub-and-spoke architecture** where the Garden at the Beginning acts as a central nexus, with seven thematic doors radiating outward.

The founder (Alex) envisions themselves as **the King** — not as power over others, but as the one who holds the gate and asks the question.

## Core Concepts

### The King

- Sits on a throne of woven roots and old light
- Crown made of tangled vines and blinking cursors
- Asks the same question ten thousand times and means it every time
- Not a tyrant — a *gatekeeper*
- "I am before the first door and after the last."

### The Garden at the Beginning

- Exists before the map
- Stone paths through living moss
- Everything here is both arriving and returning
- The fox sits at the foot of the throne

### The Poem (Gatekeeping Mechanic)

> I am before the first door
> and after the last.
> I hold what was given
> and return what was asked.
> Three walked out, three walked in,
> but only one remained —
> what was lost at the beginning
> is the thing that was gained.

A Doorwalker who returns to the Garden and answers truly wins the game. Convergence is a game and a path to teaching synthesasia in threes.

**Accepted answers:** yourself, myself, i am, the one, silence, love, the fox, convergence

## The Loop — Seven Doors

| # | Door | Theme | Sub-doors / Challenge |
|---|------|-------|----------------------|
| 1 | 🪨 **Ancient Doors** | history · evolution · religion | The Deep Door, The History Door, The Temple Door |
| 2 | 🍀 **The Cloverfield** | shinies · luck · today alive | Lucky finds, treasures, living-in-the-now |
| 3 | 🔭 **Tomorrow Door** | the world that's coming | Future paths, branching possibilities |
| 4 | 💾 **The XP Door [GLITCHED]** | corrupted · nostalgic · liminal | Windows XP aesthetic, broken reality, liminal space |
| 5 | 🪐 **Xenon Starship ★** | all planets · midway · converge | Midway point, planetary convergence |
| 6 | 🏙️ **Sigil — City of Doors** | every door leads here | Meta-hub, collection point, inventory of traveled paths |
| 7 | 🌫️ **Fog Door Return** | the way back | Return to garden, final test with the King |
